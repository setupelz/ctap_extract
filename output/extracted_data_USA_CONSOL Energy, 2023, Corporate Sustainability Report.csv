Can our coal resources be reimagined as an alternative material for making battery electrodes?19  The percentage of graphite in typical lithium battery anodes19  The amount of battery-grade graphite that is currently sourced from China19  The projected shortfall in North American battery anode supply vs. demand in 203219  Carbon from coal as lightweight aggregate in concrete  Proportion of natural graphite that must be imported to the  Coal combined with biomass and carbon capture and storage, removing CO2  from the atmosphere  We fully believe that advanced technologies such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) will likely be required to achieve global GHG emissions reduction goals. These technologies are acknowledged by the International Energy Agency as crucial components of Net Zero by 2050 scenario.20 Similarly new and emerging technologies targeting methane, a potent greenhouse gas, could also support achievement of global emissions reduction goals, across multiple sectors.

"USA_CONSOL Energy, 2023, Corporate Sustainability Report",[m],21,f610c0a295233ac0b3846b6295a98ed5,"The plant CONSOL seeks to design will be one fueled by waste coal and biomass, equipped with carbon dioxide capture and storage able to achieve net neutral or negative CO2 emissions via bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). A complete Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) study is currently underway. "

Consistent with CDP guidance for coal producers, the use of sold products category is calculated using sales volumes, combined with  default emissions and oxidation factors published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for the other bituminous and coking coal categories, as appropriate.
