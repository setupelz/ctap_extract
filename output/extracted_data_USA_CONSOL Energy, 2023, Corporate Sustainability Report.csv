"USA_CONSOL Energy, 2023, Corporate Sustainability Report",[b],64,776cbe772849d6cb8b5b82dfb7d666fa,"As a secure, reliable, and affordable source of energy, coal is a key component of economic prosperity, human health, and safety. As an always available fuel source, coal provides power plants with key reliability attributes such as quick start up and ramping, synchronous connection to the power grid, and the ability to operate for short and long periods of time.29,30 Fossil-fuel power plants are retiring much faster than renewable sources are getting developed.31 This could lead to energy supply shortages  even rolling blackouts. Coupled with increasing demand associated with electrification and new technologies like advanced computing, electric vehicles, and a push toward electric appliances as a way to decarbonize the economy, resource  estimates suggest that Americas bulk power system could be facing energy shortfalls  as soon this year.32 Energy shortfalls can carry severe consequences to human life and the economy. For instance, it was an over reliance on intermittent, renewable sources of energy during a 2021 winter storm in Texas, that contributed to the power outages that ultimately resulted in 246 deaths.33 According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, this same storm cost the Texas economy as much as 130 billion in total direct and indirect economic loss  over just two short weeks.34  Shutting down fossil fuel infrastructure as quickly as possible is often assumed to be the primary task of clean energy transitions, but this assumption  should be considered with some qualifications. The speed at which fossil fuel infrastructure can safely be retired depends crucially on the speed at which clean energy technologies are deployed and fossil fuel demand declines. Moreover, even in the Net Zero Emissions (NZE) Scenario in 2050, when no CO2 is emitted on a net basis, fossil fuel use does not fall to zero. Unplanned, chaotic or premature retirement of existing fossil fuel infrastructure could have negative consequences for energy security as well as for people. New and old systems will exist sidebyside during the transition, and effective management of their interactions is essential.35  At the same time, coal continues to facilitate the manufacturing of essential materials like steel and cement, or components of water filtration and fertilizers. Certain technologies needed to decarbonize these industrial  processes are still in the early stages of demonstration and face technical and economic challenges to near term commercialization at scale.36 These materials are essential for modern living  made possible by coal.37 In the decades to come, the global economy is expected to undergo tremendous growth. The worlds population is expected to grow by at least 21 by 2050.38 In parallel, electricity demand will skyrocket by as much as 156 by 2050, according to the NZE Scenario.39 According to the International Energy Agencys Sustainable Development Scenario, demand for many mined materials is projected to explode, putting a huge strain on limited global reserves.40 While the U.S. leads the world in proven coal reserves, it does not even make the scale for other critical materials needed for the energy transition.41  httpspjm.com-medialibraryreports-noticesspecial-reports202120210311-reliability-in-pjm-today-and-tomorrow.ashx  29 PJM Interconnection.

The CONSOL Energy teams commitment to continuous improvement means INNOVATING FOR THE FUTURE to create opportunities across the entire coal value chain. Over time, the requisites of modern society will grow and evolve. Our valuable and abundant coal resources could be utilized in entirely new ways to meet these needs  whether that could mean producing baseload power with net negative CO2 emissions, or using it as the foundation for advanced carbon products and materials. These longer term and higher value endeavors have the potential to disrupt coals historical value proposition, with a positive impact for TOMORROW. "
