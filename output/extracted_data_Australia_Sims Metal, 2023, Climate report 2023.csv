For Scope 1 and 2 targets set with a base year of 2020 or earlier, aligned to a 1.5C scenario, the absolute reduction approach prescribes a 4.2 minimum linear annual rate of reduction.10 From this approach, Sims Limited derived our existing 23 absolute reduction by 2025 target.

In their modelling of even the most ambitious trajectory for innovation, investment and adoption of decarbonisation measures, the steel industry is considered unlikely to reach net zero by 2050.16 A 2023 analysis by the IEA concludes that the current pipeline of low- and near-zero-emission projects falls short of what is required to meet the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, and high-emissions projects make up around two-thirds of all announced projects worldwide.17  By supplying more processed scrap product to customers, Sims Limited would contribute to reducing their emissions intensity (compared to making the same amount of steel from raw materials). In parallel, the increased volume would cause Sims Limiteds own Scope 3 emissions to rise, at least until there is widespread decarbonisation in the sector. "

Sims Limited participated in the public consultation process about the proposed methodology and final deliverables were released in July 2023. Steelmakers seeking to use the sector-based pathway must include  specific processes (illustrated in the core system boundary graphic below), regardless of whether they are a Scope 1, 2 or 3 emission for a particular steelmaker. This ensures SBTi targets are based on consistent, comparable accounting. "

This is different from the approach we had historically used, so during FY23 we have re-evaluated our methodology for this category. Our research indicated that a higher proportion of BOF process energy was more correctly allocated to ironmaking (from raw materials) rather than steelmaking and we adjusted our calculations accordingly. We have also included emissions from hot rolling of steel in our calculations for the first time, giving greater alignment with the SBTi core boundary. "

The economic contraction approach (i.e., emissions reduction per dollar of revenue) is not appropriate for Sims Limited due to commodity cycle volatility. The absolute  contraction approach would require a Scope 3 target of 25 reduction by 2030 (well below 2C), which is not a credible expectation for our most material contributors to Scope 3 emissions. During FY24, we will continue to evaluate and refine our methodologies and engage with stakeholders around Scope 3 target setting. "

It also includes a commitment to ensure an uptake of alternative zero and near-zero GHG fuels by 2030, as well as indicative checkpoints for 2030 and 2040, targeting at least a 20 reduction by 2030 and 70 by 2040, compared to 2008 emission levels. The new strategy is far more ambitious than the previous strategy, which aimed for a 50 reduction in emissions by 2050 and has been estimated to align with a pathway well below 2C,  although not to a 1.5C pathway.18 The IMO is expected to announce specific measures over the short and medium term to reduce emissions from ships. However, as we freight globally, it is reasonable to anticipate that low- or zero-emission shipping infrastructure may not be uniformly available across all marine routes, and that global progress will be uneven.

Current availability of zero-emission heavy freight is challenging as the electric truck market share remains low across most major markets. In 2022, 1.2 of the total number of  medium- and heavy-duty vehicles registrations worldwide were electric vehicles, and over 85 of those were in China.19 To achieve the Paris Agreement goals, the share of zero-emission HGVs needs to rise to 45 by 2030 and to nearly 100 no later than 2040, if the transportation sector is to fulfil its emissions reduction responsibilities.20  httpstheicct.orgmarine-imo-updated-ghg-strategy-jul23  There is some reason for optimism regarding the increased presence of zero-emission vehicles in the Sims Limited value chain. In 2021, the United Kingdom became the first nation in the world to commit to phasing out new, non-zero-emission HGVs weighing 26 tonnes and under by 2035, with all new HGVs sold in the United Kingdom to be zero emission by 2040.21 Research from the U.S. Department of Energy indicated that low-emissions heavy trucks are expected to become cost-competitive with diesel equivalents by 2035.22  During COP27, the United States committed to the Memorandum of Understanding on Zero-Emission Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles, where countries commit to working together to enable 100 zero-emission new truck and bus sales by 2040 with an interim goal of 30 zero-emission vehicle sales by 2030. New Zealand and the United Kingdom are also signatories. During FY23, the Australian government published the countrys first EV strategy, although limited to light vehicles.23  Sims Limited expects to take delivery of our first electric road truck in late 2023, and we will share learnings from this both internally and with our value chain.
