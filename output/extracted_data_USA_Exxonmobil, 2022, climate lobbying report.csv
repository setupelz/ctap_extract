"USA_Exxonmobil, 2022, climate lobbying report",[e],3,22a35e5b9d2a7de0b937c527d0da9c20,"ExxonMobil acknowledges the risks of climate change and has long expressed support for the goals of the Paris Agreement. Our policy principles, outlined in this report, and associated lobbying are consistent with helping society achieve its ambition for a net-zero future. Our direct lobbying activities are aligned with limiting average global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius and include strong support for policies that will incentivize carbon emission reductions while providing the energy security the world needs.

"USA_Exxonmobil, 2022, climate lobbying report",[a],4,1b03210ed07445e425c7d539ec97f39e,"For the manufacturing sector, ExxonMobils focus is on advancing carbon capture and storage and hydrogen. The and the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have identified both hydrogen and carbon capture and storage as vital to reducing emissions associated with manufacturing and heavy industry. "

An emissions-intensity standard would incentivize the necessary infrastructure and lower-emission options, including natural gas, renewables, carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and negative-emission technologies such as bioenergy with CCS, and direct air capture.
