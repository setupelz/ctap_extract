The IPCC finds that achieving a 1.5 C scenario with high confidence and without any temporary overshoot would require net zero by around 2050 (20452055). Other IPCC scenarios reach net zero later this century, but they achieve 1.5 C outcomes through greater adoption of CO removal opportunities. Achieving a 1.5 C goal will require countries to reduce emissions across all sectors of the economy. It will also require increasing removals by sinks, such as nature-based solutions (e.g., forestry), which absorb more carbon than they release, and through technology solutions (e.g., CCUS).12  The IPCC notes numerous potential pathways to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. All pathways include the continued use of oil and gas, even in rapid decarbonization scenarios. To achieve net zero emissions by 2050, direct air carbon dioxide capture and storage and carbon capture and storage (CCS) must be scaled up and globally deployed. Without this technology, the IPCC climate models cannot achieve theoretical solutions to reach net zero in the desired time frame.13  Improvements in technology can reduce energy costs, lower emissions and influence the energy mix by changing the relative competitiveness of different energy types. Four prominent areas of investment include CO removals, hydrogen, renewable fuels and battery storage. Removals, hydrogen and renewable fuels in particular are important technologies to assist in carbon intensity reduction of hard-to-abate sectors.

Negative emissions, or CO removals, are often classified as natural climate solutions and technology removals, like carbon capture. Both can be essential tools in mitigating GHG emissions and meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement (Exhibit 10).14 In its Sixth Assessment Report, the IPCC continues to recognize the importance of deploying carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods to counterbalance residual GHG emissions.15 CCUS can play a dual role in climate change mitigation It can be used for technology to remove carbon from the atmosphere with direct air capture (DAC) and reduce emissions from point sources in energy-intensive industries and power generation.16 According to the IEA Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), CCUS may grow over 100-fold by 2050.

The IEA notes that renewable fuels will be central to reducing emissions from long-distance transportation, aviation and high-temperature heat industries. Renewable fuels are particularly important in lowering the carbon intensity of transportation, serving as low-carbon solutions for existing technologies, such as light-duty vehicles in the near term and heavy-duty trucks, ships and aircraft with few alternative solutions in the long term. Many renewable fuels are compatible with existing infrastructure and can be used with existing technologies, making them an attractive lower-emissions substitute for conventional fuels. Use of renewable fuels can result in lower emissions than conventional fuels on a lifecycle basis, depending on feedstocks, production pathways, and carbon accounting treatment of emissions associated with cropland cultivation and avoided emissions. Differences in accounting treatment can result in the same biofuel appearing to have different carbon performance. "

In 2022, LNG accounted for approximately 40 of natural gas  exchanges.29 The IEA projects global gas demand to remain near 2022 levels in 2023 as growth in Asian gas markets is offset by further declines in Europe. The STEPS projects that global gas demand will increase to just over 4,300 bcm in the 2030s and will plateau around that level through 2050. Growth in natural gas demand is driven by natural gass status as a relatively cost-competitive resource, a desire among industrial consumers to diversify fuel sources, and efforts in some jurisdictions to reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. Gas markets continue to price regionally, with Asia-Pacific remaining the largest growth market for gas to 2050.30 However, Asia will continue to compete with Europe for incremental LNG supply as the latter seeks to replace lost Russian supply. Due to concerns around cost and energy security following the Russia-Ukraine military conflict, scenario ranges in future demand of natural gas are very wide for the next decade or so. A recent analysis of third-party future energy scenarios shows that forecasted natural gas demand in 2040 ranges from roughly 1,000 bcm to 7,000 bcm, a range wider than total gas demand in 2022 (4,000 bcm).

In the STEPS, product-demand growth continues as increases in demand for transportation services and petrochemicals offset lower demand due to improved vehicle efficiency, greater use of biofuels and electrification. The STEPS assumes that EVs reach over 25 of new vehicle sales globally by 2030, enabling the EV fleet to expand by 11-fold this decade. Rising EV adoption and improving vehicle efficiency contribute to reduce gasoline demand by just over 2.2 mmbd by 2040. Overall liquid fuel demand increases by over 10 mmbd by 2040 in the STEPS, with growth primarily driven by air travel, trucking, shipping and petrochemical feedstocks. Demand for high-value petrochemicals, used to produce plastics, resins and fibers (among other products), is projected to rise by almost 20 between 2021 and 2030 in the STEPS. Policies and technologies aimed at reducing plastic waste and increased chemical recycling could reduce demand for oil and gas feedstocks, but even if recycling rates increase from roughly 5 today to 50 by 2050, as in the APS, oil demand from the petrochemicals sector is expected to remain in the 15 mmbd range.
