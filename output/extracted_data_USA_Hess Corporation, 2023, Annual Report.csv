The IEAs 2022 World Energy Outlook provides three scenarios of global energy demand in 2040 based on varying levels of global response to climate change. Under all of the IEA scenarios, oil and natural gas are expected to be needed for decades to come and we expect that signicant investment will be required to meet the worlds projected growing energy needs, both in renewable energy sources and in oil and gas.
