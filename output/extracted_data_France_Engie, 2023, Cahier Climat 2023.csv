In this way, the Group is reducing its direct and indirect greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions by at least 90 compared with 2017 (2).

Such a reduction could not be achieved without the disposal of assets. These assets could not be closed Indeed, these thermal assets could not be closed, otherwise the security of the electrical system to which they are connected would be jeopardized. They would thus continue to emit GHG emissions. ENGIE is therefore playing its role as an industrial company engaged in the energy transition, remaining at this stage a key player in thermal generation, resolutely committed to decarbonizing these assets with different technologies (biomethane, carbon capture and, depending on technological developments, renewable hydrogen). To fully industrialize these technologies, despite promising changes in the regulatory framework (particularly in the EU), we believe that the credible horizon is 2040-2045. "
