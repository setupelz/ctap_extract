"USA_CONSOL Energy, 2022, Annual Report",[e],27,45df2cc26d076c088c886212e292e1d2,"Foreign governments, including the European Union and member countries, have adopted regulations governing GHG emissions. Independent of regulation, the Kyoto Protocol to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) became effective in 2005 and established a binding GHG emission reduction requirement for developed countries. The Kyoto Protocol has never been ratified by the U.S. Senate. Similarly, in December 2015, the U.S. and approximately 200 nations signed the international Paris Agreement, making voluntary commitments to limit or reduce GHG emissions in order to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius from temperatures in the preindustrial era by 2100. On June 1, 2017, the Trump Administration announced the United States withdrawal from the agreement, which became effective on November 4, 2020. On January 20, 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order bringing the United States back into the Paris Agreement as an official party. The UNFCCC convened its 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) in November 2021, and ultimately enacted the Glasgow Climate Pact to operationalize Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Article 6 establishes a framework for the voluntary international cooperation of countries to reduce GHG emissions and meet nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to the Paris Agreements goals. The Pact also calls on governments to accelerate the dissemination of technologies, and the adoption of policies, to transition toward a low-emission energy system, including by accelerating the phasedown of unabated coal power and phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies. The Pact was reaffirmed during the UNFCCCs 27th Conference of the Parties in November 2022. As a result, nations will likely come forward with revised NDCs in the future, including accelerated targets aligned with the Paris Agreements temperature goals. "
