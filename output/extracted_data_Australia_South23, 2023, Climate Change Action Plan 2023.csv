In the base case, the adoption of cleaner technologies, such as the electrification of vehicle fleets and more efficient blast furnaces, is expected to accelerate.

Accounting for recycling and increased scrap usage, primary commodity demand shows a similar trend as total demand, with the exception of nickel where significant battery recycling is incorporated. From a supply perspective, higher carbon costs compared to our base case are modelled into the cost curves. Under our FY23 1.5C scenario, a higher price outlook for most commodities (except lead) is driven by higher demand (required to incentivise new supply) and higher carbon costs faced by producers. "

Our silver-lead-zinc business will benefit from higher silver and zinc prices, which is partly offset by lower lead prices. While our alumina and aluminium businesses would also benefit from higher commodity prices, the energy intensity of these businesses means that rapid decarbonisation, by transitioning to low-carbon energy and applying new processing and energy efficiency technologies, would be required to mitigate the carbon price impact.
