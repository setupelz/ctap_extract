"Australia_APA, 2023, climate-report-2023 (not strictly SoC)",[e],15,9c6abbb751721f4fa1aa8b00a8fd125e,"Our interim commitments are a target of reducing net gas infrastructure emissions by 30 from FY21 levels by 2030, and a goal to reduce the emissions intensity of our power generation and electricity transmission infrastructure assets by 35 by 2030 (relative to FY21). We assess these commitments to be consistent with the Paris Agreement objective to limit warming to well below 2C. Our  (refer to page 25 of the Climate Transition Plan for further information) explains how we set these interim targets and goals. "
"Australia_APA, 2023, climate-report-2023 (not strictly SoC)",[e],25,3c7381eb5053d8eb724e159f624b5d5c,"APAs gas infrastructure and gas power assets present risks to manage and opportunities to be realised. While there are a wide range of long-term demand scenarios, we see gas infrastructure playing a key role in the energy transition to firm renewables, support hard-to-abate industries and provide energy solutions for the resources sector. In FY22, APA completed a stranded asset scenario analysis. We assessed a mix of four power generation and gas pipeline assets under several scenarios aligned with the Paris Agreement. The results have guided our assessment of potential financial impacts from transition risks and have been incorporated in our corporate risk register and risk processes. "
