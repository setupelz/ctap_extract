"USA_Devon Energy, 2032, Annual Report 10-k form",[e],19,9507436e8861329aaaa6a3389943605a,"With respect to more comprehensive regulation, policy makers and political leaders have made, or expressed support for, a variety of proposals, such as the development of cap-and-trade or carbon tax programs. In addition, President Biden has continued to highlight addressing climate change as a priority of his administration, and he previously released an energy plan calling for a number of sweeping changes to address climate change, including, among other measures, a national mobilization effort to achieve net-zero emissions for the U.S. economy by 2050, through increased use of renewable power, stricter fuel-efficiency standards and support for zero-emission vehicles. President Biden issued a number of executive orders in January 2021 with the purpose of implementing certain of these changes, including the rejoining of the Paris Agreement. President Biden subsequently announced a target of reducing economy-wide net GHG emissions in the U.S. by 50 to 52 below 2005 levels by 2030. At the international level, the United States  and the European Union jointly announced the launch of a Global Methane Pledge at the 26th Conference of the Parties in 2021, pursuant to which over 130 participating countries have pledged to a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions by at least 30 from 2020 levels by 2030. At the 28th Conference of the Parties in 2023, parties signed onto an agreement to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems in a just, orderly and equitable manner and increase renewable energy capacity so as to achieve net zero by 2050, though no timeline for doing so was set. Although the full impact of these actions is uncertain at this time, the adoption and implementation of these or other initiatives may result in the restriction or cancellation of oil and natural gas activities, greater costs of compliance or consumption (thereby reducing demand for our products) or an impairment in our ability to continue our operations in an economic manner.
