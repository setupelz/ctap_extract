Based on the WBCSD WRI GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard and the IPIECA standard, Scope 3 indirect GHG emissions are classified according to the categories listed (<>)in the table at page 71. For the Oil  Gas sector, the most relevant category is that related to the use of the energy products sold (Cat. 11). For this category, emissions are estimated according to the IPIECA Net Volume Accounting criterion51, using upstream equity hydrocarbon production as activity data, and assuming that all sold oil and natural gas production is consumed during 2023. Starting from the volumes of oil sold, finished products sold are calculated based on IEA conversion factors for a standard barrel of oil. The calculation of emissions includes assumptions regarding the final destination of products sold52. "
