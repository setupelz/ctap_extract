The models we have examined in this report reflect our most robust analysis to date on the  resiliency of our portfolio to both transition and physical risks related to climate change. This report considers the impacts of third-party base case, and alternative carbon-constrained, fundamental scenarios and the impact the scenarios would have on our portfolio. This report also considers the impact of exposure and sensitivity to potential physical impacts of climate change for Devon assets.

Each scenario has been analyzed for this report by the consulting firm, ICF, with modeling conducted for oil, natural gas, and propane, with the latter used as a proxy for natural gas liquids. The first base case scenario is based on ICFs assumptions, and the second is based on widely referenced projections by the International Energy Agency (IEA). Because the two scenarios differ in their baseline assumptions, analyzing both of them provides a level of robustness against alternative future scenarios. To model the impacts of a carbon-constrained future, the analysis applies, under both scenarios, IEAs assumptions about demand for oil and natural gas under aggressive carbon-reduction policies. The two carbon-constrained scenarios include the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), which assumes that all aspirational targets announced by governments are met on time and in full, including their longterm net zero and energy access goals and the Net Zero Emissions (NZE) Scenario, which maps out a way to achieve a 1.5 C stabilization in the rise in global average temperatures, alongside universal access to modern energy by 2030.2 In the IEAs APS, CO2 emissions peak in the mid2020s and fall to around 12 Gt in 2050, which thereby limits global median temperature rise in 2100 to about 1.7 C. This nears the Paris Agreement goal of limiting the temperature rise to well below 2 C.3 In the NZE Scenario, CO2 emissions decline to 23 Gt in 2030 and to zero in 2050 while also achieving a 75 reduction in energyrelated methane emissions to 2030. In that scenario, global temperature peaks below 1.6 C around 2040, before dropping to around 1.4 C in 2100. As a result, the NZE Scenario (i) aligns with the goal agreed to in Glasgow at COP26 in 2021 to pursue efforts to limit the temperature  increase to 1.5 C and (ii) is fully aligned with the Paris Agreement.4 For more detail on methodology, please refer to the appendix of this report.

It assumes continued growth in demand for natural gas in North America (8 growth between 2023 and 2050), including liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports and pipeline exports to Mexico. Global oil market growth is assumed from the IEA forecast. Regarding clean energy targets and carbon pricing, ICFs Base Case accounts for United States (U.S.) and Canada territorial, state, and local Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) targets and other legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including the Inflation Reduction Act. The Base Case also assumes a regional, probability-weighted CO2 price for the power sector with a national carbon price that begins in 2036.1 At these levels, the carbon prices further exhibit the advantages of natural gas over coal as a source of non-intermittent power in the U.S. In ICFs Base Case, natural gas demand from the power sector increases until 2035 as demand pivots from coal to gas and natural gas complements the deployment of renewable power generation by providing a flexible source of power.

The IEA explains that natural gas demand in the 2022 Outlook is around 750 bcm lower in 2050 than projected in the 2021 Outlook. While this is due to a combination of factors like higher near-term prices, more rapid electrification of heating demand, and new policy initiatives (including the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act), the general driver is a higher projected conversion from natural gas to renewables. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act is the primary reason why U.S. natural gas demand in the 2022 STEPS scenario is 250 bcm lower by 2050 compared to the 2021 STEPS scenario. "

In the APS, North American oil exports increase almost as much as in the STEPS, as they reach 7.3 mmbd in 2030 and 7.5 mmbd for 2050. Due to domestic oil demand falling faster in the APS, the U.S. increases exports, which, paired with falling exports in the Middle East and Russia, leads to the share of North American oil production being exported increasing from 28 for 2030 and 51 for 2050. The North American share of global oil production for 2050 is 26. In the NZE Scenario roughly 10 mmbd are still traded globally by 2050, which the WEO states are mostly from North American and Middle Eastern exports.

ICF did not conduct a breakeven analysis of the natural gas prices, because the majority of the natural gas that Devon produces is associated with its oil production, and thus provides income in addition to the revenue from selling oil. Therefore, the resiliency of Devons portfolio is expected to be primarily driven by oil prices and not by natural gas prices. The natural gas prices in the IEAs and ICFs NZE Scenario are at levels that would make it difficult for most gas-directed drilling to be profitable with current drilling technology. Low natural gas prices could induce greater demand for natural gas, however, and provide an additional source of income for oil producers. Consistent with the breakeven prices for oil, breakeven prices for natural gas also have the potential to decline over time as drilling techniques and technology improve. Consequently, even though most of Devons current portfolio is focused on oil production, there is potential for natural gas to provide incremental income for oil-directed drilling and, furthermore, changes in gas prices are unlikely to impact the results of the breakeven analysis.

The results of the ICF asset sensitivity assessment indicate that Devon will experience various chronic and acute risks to our physical assets, under the modeled scenarios. While acute risks may result in sudden failure of assets and disruption of operations, chronic risks pose other issues, such as prematurely aging assets and altering standard operating practices. Operational procedures may need to be updated to account for these chronic changes, such as revised employee safety guidance to account for generally warmer working conditions, or floodproofing of facilities that would be expected to experience more precipitation and routine flooding. Additionally, asset standards and ratings may also need to be adjusted and existing assets may need to be retrofitted to account for changes in temperature and precipitation. Many of the assessed acute sensitivities are related to extreme winter weather which, as shown in the climate exposure assessment, is generally projected to decrease in exposure risk across Devons operated areas by mid-century. To address the risks posed by current and future extreme weather hazards, Devon has developed robust emergency planning, response, and recovery efforts.

ICF converted the worldwide oil importer price to a WTI price forecast by carrying forward the 2021 difference between the IEA importer average price and the 2021 average WTI price. This difference was about 1Bbl. "
"USA_Devon Energy, 2023, Climate Change Assessment Report",[b],36,82d306f0111f463d8a87a6e7ea9ca674,Natural gas prices for the ICF APS and NZE Scenarios were estimated by applying an ICF-derived price elasticity for natural gas to the demand change between the IEA STEPS and the APS and NZE Scenarios. ICFs long-term natural gas price elasticity is about 0.8 (Figure 12).

The elasticity is calculated by dividing the percentage change in oil demand by the percentage change in oil price. Natural gas price elasticity of demand is calculated with the same methodology as oil price elasticity of demand using IEAs natural gas price and demand forecast.
