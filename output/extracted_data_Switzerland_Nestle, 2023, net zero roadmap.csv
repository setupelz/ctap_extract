"Switzerland_Nestle, 2023, net zero roadmap","[d, k]",6,6b61332ca1a70f2ea562042a1bb10130,"In setting our targets, we have followed the Science Based Targets initiatives (SBTi) criteria. They provide a clearly defined pathway for coupling future-proof growth with reductions in GHG emissions. As our Scope 3 emissions make up 95 of our footprint, we are addressing more than 80 of these. The SBTi approved our targets in November 2020. "
"Switzerland_Nestle, 2023, net zero roadmap",[d],8,efad301d01c5018dadd0c716ed90c08d,Estimated GHG in 2030 according to business-as- usual scenario   Original baseline  Updated figures are available in the latest  Our net zero commitment by 2050 includes SBTi-approved near-term targets of 50 reduction of our annual net GHG emissions by 2030 compared to the 2018 baseline. 
"Switzerland_Nestle, 2023, net zero roadmap","[k, o]",18,4075a3ebd29d711c1193dc3107b7a159,"By 2030, we forecast a 44 reduction in GHG emissions from investing in soil health and forests compared to our 2018 in-scope baseline. Up to 80 of the target can be addressed through carbon Scope 3 removals delivered by agroforestry, improved agricultural practices and tackling deforestation. "
"Switzerland_Nestle, 2023, net zero roadmap",[e],41,bc16bad9db54419a96b700901caf107e,We support progressive climate action and public policies that align with the Paris Agreement and the 1.5C pathway. Nestl will continue to be a positive change agent and help countries set and meet ambitious climate targets. 
"Switzerland_Nestle, 2023, net zero roadmap",[e],41,523caa7b0df474e288f3ba430973a387,"All our climate change lobbying activities align with the goal of restricting global temperature increases to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and this translates into specific advocacy efforts at global, regional and country levels. We promote the same approach in the activities of trade associations and other types of private sector- led coalitions where Nestl is a member at global, regional and local levels. In our Nestl Climate Advocacy Industry Associations Review, we transparently publish an assessment of our main industry associations positions and advocacy activities on climate matters and take action in case of misalignments, as per the Global Standard (<httpsclimate-lobbying.comdownloads>)on Responsible Climate Lobbying.

"
"Switzerland_Nestle, 2023, net zero roadmap","[e, f]",45,4461af1a928818c3507ebd45862c47e5,"In 2015, to respond to the threat of climate change, countries around the world convened in Paris under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. They agreed to keep global temperature rises below 2 degrees Celsius (C) above pre-industrial levels, and to work toward a 1.5C limit. "
"Switzerland_Nestle, 2023, net zero roadmap","[d, k]",45,30d3d8faf7a43589884e940cb53bc643,"Net zero at the corporate level (based on the Science Based Targets initiative) Net zero emissions are achieved when anthropogenic emissions of GHGs to the atmosphere are balanced by anthropogenic Scope 3 removals over a specified period. The climate metric used here is CO2 equivalent (CO2e), and all GHG emissions are in scope. "
