The development of the claims architecture for BVCM claims has been led by the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative (VCMI), a group Unilever has engaged with over the past three years. "", ""Unilever does not use carbon credits to meet our near-term GHG reduction targets. A carbon credit is a financially tradable instrument that represents a reduction, removal, or avoidance of one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent achieved by a project. They are used by businesses and individuals to account for activity that they have funded. Carbon credits have drawn criticism for their use in offsetting whereby a company uses carbon credits generated from projects outside its value chain to compensate for emissions in its operations or within its value chain. Offsetting does not lower the company's gross emissions footprint. ""]"
"UK_Unilever, 2024, climate transition action plan updated 2024","[IPCC, IEA]","[""The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change defines net zero emissions as when “anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere are balanced by anthropogenic removals over a specified period.” Our Net Zero by 2039 ambition means that we will seek to balance any unabated emissions within the scope of our Net Zero by 2039 ambition, from 2039, with the same volume of like-for-like carbon removals. Whilst we are applying this UN definition in this CTAP, we anticipate that this definition of 'net zero' will likely need to adapt over time to ensure alignment with developing global standards. Currently Race to Zero Criteria 3.0, ISO Net Zero Guidelines (IEA 42:2022) and the SBTi Corporate Net Zero Standard have implemented alternative definitions and we expect work will be necessary to agree a global standard.
