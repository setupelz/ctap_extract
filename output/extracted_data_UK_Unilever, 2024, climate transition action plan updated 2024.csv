It increases resilience, improves efficiency, and future-proofs our value chain against transition risks such as carbon prices, while sparking innovation and helping to attract the best talent. In proactively managing our transition to net zero, we also ensure we respond to the opportunities and risks highlighted through our Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) scenario analysis process.

The focus of our efforts between now and the end of this decade is to deliver absolute GHG reductions, even as we grow our business. While we will seek out opportunities to reduce emissions and encourage carbon removals within our value chain (e.g. through regenerative agricultural practices), our plan does not include the purchase of carbon credits to meet our near-term GHG reduction targets.

"UK_Unilever, 2024, climate transition action plan updated 2024",[k],23,c69f04fa18518e47581b6945b4e3a153,"Accurately quantifying the emissions reduction or carbon removal benefits of the agricultural practices we support in our upstream value chain is critical to meeting our targets. We adhere to the GHG Protocol Standards but believe they will need to evolve if companies are to be encouraged to contribute to collective efforts to protect and regenerate nature within the agricultural landscapes from which they source. This could mean permitting companies to account for a share of GHG emissions reductions or removals within the supply sheds from which they source, even in the absence of physical traceability. In our plan, we assume that these changes will come about in the next seven years and therefore, that Unilever will be permitted to count the benefits of our work in forest-risk commodities, regenerative agriculture, and lower carbon dairy towards the delivery of our near-term Scope 3 GHG reduction targets. We plan to actively engage with the GHG Protocol to shape the evolution of these standards. Without such an evolution, many companies, including Unilever, will struggle to demonstrate how they are meeting their ambitious GHG reduction targets. "

The Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition, of which Unilever is a member, launched a High-Level Commission on Carbon Pricing in 2015. The Commissions report, released in 2017, concluded that a carbon price of 40-80 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) by 2020, rising to 50-100 per tonne by 2030, when combined with supportive policies, would allow for the achievement of the Paris goal. We therefore use a shadow carbon price of 70t CO2e, a figure which is reviewed annually. This provides an alternate view of capital expenditure business cases with the benefits and risks associated with GHG emissions priced in, and acts as a form of carbon sensitivity analysis when making capital expenditure investment decisions in our operations.

"UK_Unilever, 2024, climate transition action plan updated 2024",[l],47,96221c8070a08a6d43ce9e436b7f1095,"Unilever does not use carbon credits to meet our near-term GHG reduction targets. A carbon credit is a financially tradable instrument that represents a reduction, removal, or avoidance of one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent achieved by a project. They are used by businesses and individuals to account for activity that they have funded. Carbon credits have drawn criticism for their use in offsetting whereby a company uses carbon credits generated from projects outside its value chain to compensate for emissions in its operations or within its value chain. Offsetting does not lower the companys gross emissions footprint. "

Whilst we are applying this UN definition in this CTAP, we anticipate that this definition of net zero will likely need to adapt over time to ensure alignment with developing global standards. Currently Race to Zero Criteria 3.0, ISO Net Zero Guidelines (IEA 422022) and the SBTi Corporate Net Zero Standard have implemented alternative definitions and we expect work will be necessary to agree a global standard.
