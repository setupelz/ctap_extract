"France_EDF, 2022, climate transition plan","[d, e]",0,2d4cf1d682ad1c6b30841543e33064a8,"The Group has aligned its ambitions with the Paris Climate Agreement and has set greenhouse gas reduction targets for 2030 with a milestone in 2023, covering both its direct emissions (scope 1) and indirect emissions (scope 2 and 3). This target trajectory has been validated as Well Below 2C by the Science Based Targets initiative. "

Following the first IPCC report in 1990, the EDF Group set up a climate services department, unique among the major electricity companies, to support the Groups entities in taking into account the impact of climate change. In 2004, the EDF Group adopted a Climate Hazards plan, followed by a climate change adaptation strategy in 2010. Since 2018, climate risk has been a priority risk for the EDF Group. The scoring is supported by the conclusions of the report on the impacts, adaptation and vulnerability to climate change published by the IPCC in February 2022. "
"France_EDF, 2022, climate transition plan",[j],2,d4e34a553fbd7f7d8417b347577cf87c,"The EDF Groups climate transition plan includes an adaptation component, under the terms of which the Group undertakes, in particular, to assess the impacts of climate change and its evolution assumptions, to adapt existing facilities, to make them less sensitive to climatic conditions and resilient to extreme situations, and to integrate them into design of new facilities.
