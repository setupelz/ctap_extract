Faced with the climate emergency, the EDF Group wants to build, wherever it is present, a new energy model that emits less CO2, is more efficient and more respectful of the environment and populations2. This is in fact its raison d\'être3.

Nevertheless, the Group has made a commitment since 2018 to contribute to achieving carbon neutrality, in particular by reducing its direct greenhouse gas emissions to zero or close to zero by 2050. "", 'The Group has aligned its ambitions with the Paris Climate Agreement and has set greenhouse gas reduction targets for 2030 with a milestone in 2023, covering both its direct emissions (scope 1) and indirect emissions (scope 2 and 3).

Following the first IPCC report in 1990, the EDF Group set up a climate services department, unique among the major electricity companies, to support the Group\'s entities in taking into account the impact of climate change. In 2004, the EDF Group adopted a ""Climate Hazards"" plan, followed by a climate change adaptation strategy in 2010. Since 2018, climate risk has been a priority risk for the EDF Group.

"France_EDF, 2022, climate transition plan",[Scenario],"['During the summer of 2003, some plants had to reduce their production to avoid contributing to the warming of river water, resulting in a loss of production equivalent to 1% of EDF\'s output. The ""Grands Chauds"" (’Heatwaves’) plan subsequently led EDF to improve the cooling efficiency of some of its power plants and to reinforce the electronics of the reactor buildings in order to withstand temperatures above 50°C. The EDF Group\'s power plants currently under construction have all been designed to take into account the most recent climate scenarios.
