This increase more than negated the emissions decrease that was witnessed globally in 2020 and was driven by rapid post pandemic economic growth, slow progress in improving energy intensity and a surge in coal demand even though renewable capacity additions reached record levels.

Hess considers our short term strategy (03 years) as primarily addressing near term business decisions required for operational budgetary and planning purposes. Our short term climate related targets, which provide a step approach to achieving our longer term objectives, are as follows  Reduce routine flaring intensity to 5 in our Bakken, North Dakota, production operations in 2022  Reduce routine flaring intensity to 3 in our Bakken, North Dakota, production operations in 2023  Reduce the GHG emissions intensity of our operated assets to 17 kilograms CO2e per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) by the end of 2025  Reduce the methane emissions intensity of our operated assets to 0.19 by the end of 2025  Achieve zero routine flaring at our operated assets by the end of 2025  Purchase renewable energy certificates (RECs) to mitigate 100 of our Scope 2 GHG emissions (annual)  Our medium term strategy (410 years) primarily addresses project level changes at our various assets. In this time frame, our strategy and targets will continue to be focused on addressing Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, flaring and methane as well as purchasing renewable energy to address Scope 2 emissions.

The agreement is one of the largest private sector forest preservation agreements in the world. As Guyanas partner in this agreement, Hess will purchase high quality carbon credits for a minimum of 750 million between 2022 and 2032 directly from the government of Guyana. This multiyear agreement is for the purchase of 37.5 million high quality REDD carbon credits (current and future issuance) that are independently verified to represent permanent and additional emissions reductions. REDD (reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation) is a global conservation mechanism created by the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention in support of the Paris Agreement.
