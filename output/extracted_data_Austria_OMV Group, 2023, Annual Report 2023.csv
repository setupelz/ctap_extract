The IEA, in its most recent World Energy Outlook, shows another incremental shift in projected future demand away from coal, oil, and gas and toward renewables and electricity in its STEPS scenario, which provides a view of the energy system based on current policy settings. The gap to a trajectory that achieves the maximum temperature increases described in the Paris agreement remains significant, however. Scenarios that achieve net-zero emissions for the global energy system by 2050 require even faster deployment of low-carbon technologies and associated declines in fossil fuel demand than when they first started to emerge in 2021, due to the growth in demand in the interim.

"Austria_OMV Group, 2023, Annual Report 2023",[p],31,8cd6db047bfd56f83367c90f70ad8de8,"European fossil refining market potential is expected to decrease up to 2030, as both volumes and refining margins are forecast to be under pressure driven by the pace of the energy transition in Europe. In the same time horizon, strong growth will materialize for renewable mobility fuels, as well as sustainable chemical feed-stocks. To leverage the opportunities of the ongoing energy transition, the FF division is developing a sustainable production portfolio for renewable fuels and sustainable chemical feedstocks, such as the co-processing of biogenic feedstocks in Schwechat, reaching approximately 1.5 mn t in total by 2030. In this context, the sourcing of bio-feedstocks will be a critical success factor. 80 of OMVs feedstock requirements for 2030 already has a clear sourcing plan. In the same time period, FF will decrease crude oil distillation throughput in the Schwechat and Burghausen refineries, from 12.9 mn t in 2019 to approximately 10.3 mn t in 2030, in line with changing demand patterns. This adaptation will significantly reduce heating oil and diesel product output by 2030, while increasing the chemical yield to around 24 for the Western refineries. In the Petrobrazi refinery, the Group aims to build new production units for advanced biofuels and green hydrogen. "

In addition, renewable energy projects will also be pursued for the purpose of powering OMVs own operations. To achieve an overall reduction of both absolute and relative GHG emissions from its product portfolio, OMV Energy will leverage its existing asset base and core skills to deliver financially strong low-carbon business projects. Available opportunities will be captured to build up geothermal energy capacity that generates up to 9 TWh p.a. by 2030. In addition to geothermal, around 1 TWh from renewable power will be developed in OMV core regions with favorable sun and wind condi- tions to serve primarily captive demand, thereby reducing Scope 2 emissions by OMVs own operations. The Energy business will further tap into its existing reservoirs and (sub-)surface capabilities to implement opportunities that lead to a CCS capacity of approximately 5 mn t p.a. of CO2 net to OMV by 2030. In addition, further opportunities where OMV Energy can leverage its strengths and capabilities are being explored, e.g., hydrogen and energy storage, and will potentially be pursued in consideration of OMVs strategic priorities.
