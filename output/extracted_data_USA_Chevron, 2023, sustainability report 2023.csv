The worlds energy needs continue to grow as populations and incomes rise, urban areas expand, and billions of people in less-developed countries seek a higher standard of living. Many energy solutions will be required to meet this demand growth as the world works toward also achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. Under a wide range of scenarios, we believe the journey to a lower carbon future will require oil and natural gas, particularly where there are currently no effective substitutes. As we have done for more than 140 years, we will continue to evolve and help meet the energy demand of a growing world. "

Other nature-based solutions include restoration of coastal and marine habitats so that they continue to draw CO2 from the air. "
