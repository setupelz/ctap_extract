The following data table is based upon IPCC AR6.1,2  (metric tons COe per 100 metric tons of throughput or production)  (metric tons COe per 100 metric tons of production)  (metric tons COe per 100 metric tons of throughput)  (metric tons COe per 100 metric tons of production)  (metric tons CH4 per 100 metric tons of throughput or production)  (metric tons COe per 100 metric tons of throughput or production)  (metric tons COe per 100 metric tons production)  (metric tons COe per 100 metric tons of throughput)  (metric tons COe per 100 metric tons production)  (metric tons CH per 100 metric tons of throughput or production)  Lloyds Register Quality Assurance has provided their independent limited level of assurance that the 2022 ExxonMobil greenhouse gas emissions inventory meets ISO 14064-3 expectations.

Scope 3 estimates represent three approaches for accounting and are not meant to be aggregated, as this would lead to duplicative accounting. "
