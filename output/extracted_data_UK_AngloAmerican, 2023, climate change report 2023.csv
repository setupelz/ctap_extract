As predicted by the UNs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this degree of warming is causing extreme weather events to become both more regular and more extreme all around the world. Meanwhile, COP28 clearly demonstrated that actions taken thus far are not sufficient to contain the global temperature rise to the 1.5oC aspiration set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement. At the same time, given the mineral intensity of the transition to a low carbon world, minings role as an integral part of the solution has never been clearer.

It remains challenging, but we are committed to delivering against it and continue to look for innovative, effective and profitable ways to do so. We have also always been clear that our trajectory to carbon neutrality would not be linear and that our plans to get there would likely change along the way, as technologies evolve and as we, and others, learn from experience. Nevertheless, this years data shows a continued steady reduction in emissions, crucially beginning to demonstrate a disconnect between production volumes and emissions. Meanwhile, our target to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040 has been independently verified as being aligned with the expectations of the Paris Agreement. "

For example, the rail line from our Sishen mine to the Saldanha port, critical to our Kumba iron ore operations in South Africa, is a bottleneck that continues to cause disruptions. Analysis of our internal data on the current causes indicates that over the period 20202022, 21 of the disruptions on the Sishen-Saldanha rail were weather related. The projected increase in extreme weather across South Africa will further increase the pressure on this railway, potentially increasing the rate of wash-aways, derailments and traffic stoppages due to extreme temperatures and excessive rainfall.

Evolving our approach to incorporate the effects of a changing climate is therefore critical to ensure our plans remain fit for purpose. One area where we are incorporating climate change variables is our landform evolution modelling, used to determine the long term stability of final landforms under a changing climate. During 2023, we ran two pilot revised landform models for our Sishen iron ore operation in South Africa and Moranbah steelmaking coal operation in Australia. Both sites are located in semi-arid areas with low precipitation levels. For each site, we were able to incorporate relevant changing precipitation scenarios, using projected monthly averages and testing various rain intensities, as well as ground cover percentages. The results suggest that, at both sites, erosion would reduce against the baseline, except in an SSP5 scenario, when Moranbah would see an exceedance of acceptable rates of erosion. These initial results increase confidence that, at these sites, climate change may not exacerbate erosion and reduce landform stability in the long term, but nevertheless will remain under review. In 2024, we anticipate continuing to test this modelling in operating regions with higher rainfall to understand how such areas would be affected. "

Almost all scientific models and net zero scenarios assume significant (1011 Gt CO2e) absorption of carbon dioxide by the natural world per year through carbon sinks, such as forests, wetlands and peatlands.

However, the SBTi has yet to develop a methodology to assess the diversified mining sector and currently excludes target verification for any company deriving more than 5 revenue from fossil fuel assets  drawing no distinction between fossil fuel produced for steel production as opposed to energy. As a consequence, it is not yet possible for us to secure SBTi verification for the level of ambition of the Anglo American Group targets, although De Beers received SBTi verification for its targets, a sub-set of the wider Group targets, in 2023.
