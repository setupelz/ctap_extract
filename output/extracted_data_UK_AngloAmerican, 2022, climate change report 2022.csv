Under the 3C scenario, with our current asset footprint and organic growth options, we expect stable cash flows to 2035. Similarly, we expect our cash flow to remain resilient under both the 2C and 1.5C scenarios, but with greater uncertainty given the broad range of potential pathways to achieve the low carbon outcomes. For example, in the next decade under the 1.5C scenario, our cash flow could be up to 30 higher relative to the 3C scenario. In the subsequent decade, our cash flow could be 2025 lower under the 1.5C scenario, relative to the 3C scenario. This range of uncertainty falls within our risk tolerance. In addition, the optionality in our portfolio will allow us to further strengthen our resilience and offset any potential downside risks to our cash flow. "

We have begun to use a climate change scenario analysis solution specifically for our assessment of physical climate change risks that uses multiple Global Climate Model (GCM) projections dynamically downscaled to a local level to provide projected changes in climate and hazard estimates for each of our assets and key shipping ports over the period 2020 to 2100. The modelling is based on three of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) used in the IPCC Sixth Assessment report on climate change SSP12.6, SSP24.5 and SSP58.5(1). These scenarios project warming of 1.8oC, 2.7oC and 4.4oC respectively by 2100. This analysis provides us with a top-down view of key physical climate change hazards across our portfolio. To complement this, we have defined a bottom-up approach to understand the climate context at a local and regional level, including understanding past weather trends and present emerging climate-related impacts, as well as vulnerabilities and adaptive capacities particular to each site.

The Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi) is widely cited as a means of providing some assurance of the level of ambition. However, the SBTi has yet to develop a methodology to assess the diversified mining sector and currently excludes target verification for any company deriving more than 5 revenue from fossil fuel assets  drawing no distinction between fossil fuel produced for steel production as opposed to energy. As a consequence, it is not yet possible for us to secure SBTi verification for the level of ambition of the Anglo American Group targets, although De Beers has submitted its targets, a sub-set of the wider Group targets, for SBTi verification. Nevertheless, we considered it important to assess whether our Scope 1 and 2 targets were aligned with the ambition assumed in the Paris Agreement. "

This review compared the emissions reductions we were targeting between 2020 and 2030 with the multiple 1.5C pathways defined by the UNs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The outcomes of this work can be summarised as follows  A consultant-supported exercise was performed in 2021 by Anglo American to assess the Groups emissions profile and targets against a set of 37 publicly accessible global pathways collated by the IPCC that limit the global temperature increase to 1.5C and that reach net zero emissions before, or at, 2050. Against those scenarios, the 2030 target was more ambitious than 19 of the pathways. While these results are not definitive, they indicate that the Group Scope 1 and Scope 2 2030 target is within the range of those IPCC 1.5C global pathways. "
