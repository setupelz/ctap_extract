Retrospective changes to the 2019 Scope 2 market based emissions baseline methodology to align with the prevailing UBS methodology have resulted in significant changes to the 2019 Scope 1 and 2 baseline used to calibrate the 61% reduction target. The original baseline adopted a GHGP-aligned renewable electricity definition which has subsequently been changed to a more stringent RE-100 definition. The impact of this is a reduction in the renewable electricity coverage across our updated 2019 baseline, and a corresponding increase in our Scope 2 market based emissions figures.
