AR offsets should ideally be used in the path towards a net zero ambition, while CDRs are required to achieve a net zero emissions end state. AR offsets are used to compensate for on-site emission reductions on the path to a net zero ambition and must meet strict standards in their use. CDRs are required to neutralise hard-to-abate residual emissions, after significant absolute reductions have already been achieved, to claim net zero. Simply put, to claim net zero emissions, the amount of GHGs added is no more than the amount taken away following the mitigation hierarchy. "
