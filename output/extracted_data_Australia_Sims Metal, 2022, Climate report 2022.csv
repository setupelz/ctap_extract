It confirmed that the actions made during this decade will determine whether warming is limited to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and if the most severe impacts of climate change are prevented. Since the release, we have elevated our ambitions on combating climate change, reflecting both the urgency of action needed to address this shared global challenge, as well as the opportunity presented by the transition to a low-carbon circular economy.

The IPCC states that climate change is already causing more frequent and severe  extreme weather events including floods, droughts and wildfires. It also emphasises that limiting warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels is necessary to avoid the most catastrophic physical impacts of climate change, and to safeguard natural ecosystems, human health and societies. As a company, we acknowledge this science and have considered these reports in our strategy and governance. In FY22, we announced new targets for our climate action, which are more ambitious than those we previously released. "

Targets are considered science-based if they are in line with what the best available climate science says is necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Agreements ambitious aim to limit average global warming to well below 2C by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit warming even further to 1.5C.

Current availability of zero-emissions heavy  freight is challenging. In 2021, less than 0.3 percent of the total number of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles registrations worldwide were electric vehicles.17 To achieve the Paris Agreement goals, the share of zero-emissions HGVs needs to rise to 45 percent by 2030 and to nearly 100 percent no later than 2040, if the transportation sector is to fulfil its emission reduction responsibilities.18  There is some reason for optimism regarding the increased presence of zero-emission vehicles in the Sims Limited value chain. In 2021, the United Kingdom became the first country in the world to commit to phasing out new, non-zero-emission HGVs weighing 26 tonnes and under by 2035, with all new HGVs sold in the United Kingdom to be zero-emission by 2040.19 Research  from the U.S. Department of Energy indicated that low-emissions heavy trucks are expected to become cost-competitive with diesel equivalents by 2035.20  We will take a collaborative approach with our value chain in seeking to decarbonise third-party road freight. This may involve investigating how we can support charging infrastructure or vehicle availability for owner-drivers, leveraging our own efforts to decarbonise our vehicle fleet. In general, we seek to minimise road travel distances through strategic location of our metal processing sites near deep-water ports, which minimises freight costs, as well as emissions. "
