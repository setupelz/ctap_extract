We do not undertake climate modelling ourselves, but we are consistent with the estimates for temperature and cumulative temperature between 2020 to  2050 in the SSPs. The emissions pathway of Aspirational Leadership is most closely aligned with the IPCCs shared socio-economic pathway 1 (SSP1-1.9) with emissions reaching net zero by 2050, which limits warming to 1.5C. Competitive Leadership is most closely aligned with SSP1-2.6 (approximately 2C of warming) and Fragmented Leadership is aligned with emission scenarios SSP2-4.5 (temperatures exceeding 2.5C by 2100). We also use the IPCCs highest emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5) when assessing the physical risks of climate change. So, when assessing risks and opportunities to the business we use a 1.5C-aligned scenario to assess a fast low-carbon transition and we use the highest emissions and high temperature outcome scenario (SSP5-8.5) to assess physical climate risks. While there are many uncertainties about how a changing climate may negatively affect gross domestic product (GDP) growth, physical impacts of climate change are integrated into the GDP growth assumptions in our three scenarios. These are most significant in Fragmented Leadership and least significant in Aspirational Leadership. The steel sector  transition scenarios in the value chain section of this report are presented to highlight the roles and timing of different low-carbon steelmaking technologies and to develop projections of our potential future Scope 3 emissions from processing our iron ore.
