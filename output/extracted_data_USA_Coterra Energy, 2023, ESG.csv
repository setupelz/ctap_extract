Evaluation and consideration of future uncertainties is critical to maintaining our business agility and strengthening our capital allocation process. We test the strength and resiliency of our portfolio by sensitizing our internal financial models to multiple macro-commodity pricing scenarios. Specifically related to climate change, we utilize the models developed by two of the largest organizations that collect and track energy data, the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the United States (U. S.) Energy Information Administration (EIA). The IEA has three scenarios presented in their 2022 World Energy Outlook (WEO), and the EIA has nine scenarios presented in their 2023 Annual Energy Outlook (AEO). Energy demand, mix, and prices vary across the scenarios, primarily driven by varying degrees of public policy assumptions for the IEA scenarios. "

"USA_Coterra Energy, 2023, ESG","[b, e]",7,382e4dde9063fe6dce9f2333b5acb0e3,"EIA Base Case and STEPS are not designed to achieve a particular outcome. Their outcomes are the result of  assumptions made within each scenario. Conversely, the IEA generated NZE by starting with the end goals of capping global warming at 1.5 Celsius above pre-industrial levels and achieving net zero CO2 emissions from the global energy sector by 2050. They then formulated one possible set of assumptions that allowed for their model to achieve the desired outcome. Due to the assumptions being developed secondary to the end goal in this scenario, it  is important to evaluate the feasibility of the assumptions in NZE. "

These proposed efficiencies may be difficult to achieve. "

This is driven by significant cost reduction assumptions for low-carbon technologies, including capital costs9 that decline 61, 63, and 14 for solar photo-voltaic, offshore wind, and onshore wind, respectively, over the 20202050 period. Even with the cost reductions, wind capital costs are still higher than combined- cycle natural gas capital costs. Solar capital costs are lower than combined-cycle natural gas, but solar also has a significantly lower capacity factor due to solars daily intermittency. Additionally, IEA acknowledges that the NZEs lower demand assumption is critical to limiting overall investment required in this scenario. NZE proposed costs may be understated. "
"USA_Coterra Energy, 2023, ESG",[b],8,d7ace92654642bd5da0091c9324a7862,"North American oil and gas production  expected to remain resilient  In EIA Base Case, oil and gas production grow approximately 12 and 15 respectively through 2050. In STEPS, North American oil and gas production remains resilient and maintains substantial global market share after growing over the next decade. NZE assumes advanced economies implement a 250tonne carbon tax by 2050, inflating the cost to produce hydrocarbon. This results in North America conceding natural-gas market share to regions with higher estimated emission intensities andor regions that do not have a carbon tax. However, in order to more effectively reduce global emissions, production should be weighted toward the lower emission intensity producers with scale. As the worlds largest, and one of the lower methane emitting producers,12 the U.S. will likely remain  a strong contender for global market share in a low- carbon scenario. "
