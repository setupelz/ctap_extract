Meeting the Paris Agreement goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees above preindustrial levels, and pursuing efforts to limit that increase to 1.5 degrees, will require an unprecedented global effort to halve greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions this decade, achieve a net zero position by 2050 at the latest and shift to an overall removal of GHGs on an annual basis post-2050.

However, some of these projects may generate carbon credits, and brands may seek to use those credits to support consumer-facing claims of carbon neutrality. Where this happens, this would be in addition to making progress towards our emissions reduction targets, not a means of achieving them.  On the following page, we explain why. "

We recognise that there is a societal debate on biomass as a zero-emission fuel source.  Were the guidance to change to prevent biomass being counted as zero-emission, this could impact our ability to achieve a 100 reduction by 2030. However, thanks to the decarbonisation achieved through renewable electricity and other renewable thermal technologies (for example, solar thermal), we believe our emissions reduction by 2030 would still be consistent with the 1.5-degree ambition of the Paris Agreement.

High-level advocacy in support of the goals of the Paris Agreement  With the UN Climate Conference  COP26  on the horizon, countries must step forward with strengthened emissions reduction plans. These should include targets to achieve net zero by mid-century, interim targets consistent with a Paris-aligned pathway, and enabling policy measures to support delivery. Unilever engages through many global associations to express our support for these goals at international events. These include the UN Secretary Generals Climate Action Summit and the UN Climate Change Conference. Our five global strategic partners in this effort are the UN Global Compact, the World Economic Forum, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, the We Mean Business Coalition and the Consumer Goods Forum.

"UK_Unilever, 2021, climate transition action plan 2021",[e],37,fbf910add1ef48a689d4e62e3d62bf45,"Renewable energy  Two-thirds of the end-to-end footprint of our products occurs in the home, primarily associated with the energy used to heat water required for their use. In product categories such as skin cleansing it can be over 80, - as products such as shower gels and soaps are often used with large volumes of hot water. Yet Unilever has no direct control over the carbon intensity of those emissions. Having spent five years in the early days of the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan exploring the potential of environmental behaviour-change campaigns, we have concluded that in the categories in which we operate, these campaigns are unlikely to drive down emissions at a pace consistent with the 1.5-degree ambition of the Paris Agreement. A better strategy is to support the accelerated deployment of renewable energy worldwide to reduce and remove these emissions altogether. "

Unilever has long championed the importance of aligning indirect climate lobbying (through trade associations) with an organisations climate position.

In an ideal world, we would not need any. Still, in choosing a broad scope of emissions, including upstream and some downstream emissions, and bringing the date forwards to 11 years ahead of the 2050 goal implicit in the Paris Agreement, we expect that an element of balancing emissions removals will be necessary.
