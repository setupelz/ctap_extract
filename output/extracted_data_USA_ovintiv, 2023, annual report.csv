"USA_ovintiv, 2023, annual report",[e],43,050b785e8bdb95ef75c3ee3b224297cf,"The U.S. and Canadian federal governments, along with several provincial and state governments, have also announced intentions to adhere to certain international protocols regarding GHG emissions and regulate GHGs and certain air pollutants. In addition to federal action, many state and provincial officials have stated their intent to intensify efforts to regulate GHG emissions, including methane, from the oil and natural gas industry. These governments are currently developing andor implementing regulatory and policy frameworks to deliver on their announcements. For example, effective February 19, 2021, the United States officially rejoined the Paris Agreement, an international accord to address climate change through voluntary and non-binding commitments to reduce GHG emissions by signatory nations. Pursuant to its pledge under the Paris Agreement, the United States has committed to reducing its net GHG emissions by 50-52 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. In Canada, the Government of Canada (a) has committed to cutting Canadas net GHG emissions by 40-45 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 in accordance with its pledge under the Paris Agreement (b) is gradually raising the federal carbon tax to C170tonne CO2e by 2030 and (c) has announced its intention to impose a hard cap on GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas industry, seek to reduce methane emissions from the oil and natural gas industry by 75 percent below 2012 levels by 2030 and ensure GHG emission reductions are on a pace and scale sufficient to reach net-zero by 2050. In November 2021, the Unites States, Canada, and other countries entered into the Glasgow Climate Pact, which includes a range of measures designed to address climate change, including but not limited to the phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies, reducing methane emissions 30 percent by 2030, and cooperating toward the advancement of the development of clean energy. Similar regulatory and policy framework efforts were committed to at the 2023 UN Climate Change Conference (COP28) in late 2023. We actively participate in certain provincial industrial emission programs offered by both Alberta and British Columbia that allow for the generation of offsets and other rebates to incentivize emission reduction projects and mitigate carbon tax costs. We expect to continue to be able to utilize these provincial programs in the future to migrate our carbon tax costs. "
"USA_ovintiv, 2023, annual report",[d],45,3a1b75730f75c51863babd7a1b272757,"Since 2021, we have disclosed scenario planning analysis in alignment with recommendations of the Financial Stability Boards Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). This expanded climate-focused scenario planning framework included forecasts of future demand and pricing in energy markets, as well as changes in government regulations and policy. Given the dynamic nature of the Companys business, the Company performs scenario analyses with five-year time horizons. When analyzing longer-term TCFD scenarios, we rely on external analysis for demand scenarios, carbon pricing, and comparison-pricing scenarios, which are then compared to our internally prepared base-case pricing analysis. Given the numerous estimates that are required to run these scenarios, our estimates could differ materially from actual results. Additionally, the scenario analyses we currently perform may not be comparable to scenario analyses performed by our peers or frameworks established as a result of any future regulatory requirements. By electing to set and share publicly these metrics in our sustainability report and our commitment to expand upon its disclosures, our business may also face increased scrutiny related to sustainability initiatives.
