The Paris Agreement aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C above preindustrial levels. Shell supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, which is to limit the rise in global average temperature this century to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. "

To help us get there, we have set short-, medium- and long-term targets to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, measured using our net carbon intensity metric. We believe these targets are aligned with a 1.5C pathway derived from scenarios developed for the IPCCs Sixth Assessment (AR6) Report. "

CCS is a combination of technologies that capture and store carbon dioxide deep underground or under the seabed, preventing its release into the atmosphere. "
