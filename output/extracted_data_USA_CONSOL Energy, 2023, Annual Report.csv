"USA_CONSOL Energy, 2023, Annual Report",[e],27,74dd34fa646249750c01ab9ef02469c0,"Foreign governments, including the European Union and member countries, have adopted regulations governing GHG emissions. Independent of regulation, the Kyoto Protocol to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) became effective in 2005 and established a binding GHG emission reduction requirement for developed countries. The Kyoto Protocol has never been ratified by the U.S. Senate. Similarly, in December 2015, the U.S. and approximately 200 nations signed the international Paris Agreement, making voluntary commitments to limit or reduce GHG emissions in order to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius from temperatures in the pre-industrial era. After the Trump Administration announced the United States withdrawal from the agreement in 2017, President Biden signed an Executive Order in January 2021 bringing the United States back into the Paris Agreement as an official party. The UNFCCC convened its 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) in November 2021, and ultimately enacted the Glasgow Climate Pact to establish a framework for the voluntary international cooperation of countries to reduce GHG emissions and meet nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to the Paris Agreements goals. The Pact was reaffirmed during the UNFCCCs COP27 in November 2022 and further memorialized with ratification of the UAE Consensus at the UNFCCCs COP28 in December 2023. Under the Consensus, signatories are called upon to achieve a 43 reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 (compared to 2019 levels) through actions such as the accelerated phase-down of unabated coal power and other measures that drive the transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems. As a result, nations are expected to revise and develop ambitious economy-wide NDCs by 2025, including plans to accelerate targets aligned with the Paris Agreements temperature goals. "
