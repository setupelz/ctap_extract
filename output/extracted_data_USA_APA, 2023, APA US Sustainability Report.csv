When formulating our long-term investment and development plans, we consider a range of pricing scenarios, including scenarios in a carbon-constrained world that assess the potential climate-related risks and opportunities influencing fossil fuel supply and demand. However, to continue to improve our understanding of the potential risks and opportunities associated with climate change, we updated our TCFD-aligned, climate-focused scenario planning analysis in 2023. This analysis includes forecasts of future demand and pricing in energy markets and changes in government regulations and policy that might occur based on different scenarios. "
"USA_APA, 2023, APA US Sustainability Report",[d],33,f8314de2b982552e484a52e02d7ed42f,"Given the dynamic nature of our business, APA traditionally performs annual scenario analyses with five-year time horizons, which include the input of experts from several internal functional areas. However, we appreciate the value of climate-related financial analysis with longer-term supply demand, regulatory frameworks and pricing taken into consideration, as recommended by TCFD. In 2021, we first incorporated these longer-term views into our planning process, using external analysis for demand, carbon and commodity comparison-pricing scenarios. These external cases are then compared to our internally prepared base-case pricing analysis, averaged out to 2040. "

Scenario planning has long been embedded in our ongoing business and risk management processes, to assess how commodity demand drives the price for our products. Two recent examples include the oil price crash that resulted from plummeting demand due to COVID-19 and the impact of Russian aggression in Ukraine on natural gas prices across Europe. Undertaking scenario analyses is particularly important given that our international asset portfolio exposes us to multiple commodity prices and a broader range of regulatory pressures than those experienced by pure-play operators or our U.S. onshore-focused peers. Our scenario-planning analysis includes the input of experts from multiple internal functional areas for a more rigorous, multidisciplinary approach. "

These include scenarios of a carbon-constrained future, which reflect the potential climate-related risks and opportunities influencing fossil fuel supply and demand. However, our expanded, climate-specific scenario-planning framework goes even further, by including market-based third-party forecasts of future demand and of pricing in energy markets, based on assumptions concerning changes in government regulations and policy.

"USA_APA, 2023, APA US Sustainability Report","[d, i]",122,72b131e58d39c0e1e751796039c64868,"The TCFD guidance recommends that companies consider risks relating to the potential impact of climate change over near-, medium- and long-term time frames. The dynamic nature of our business has been clearly demonstrated by the commodity price volatility observed over the last three years, driven by the global pandemic and by geopolitical impacts on global markets. Given such volatility, we believe that our scenario analyses should be conducted over medium-term time frames since, in our view, it is challenging to accurately assess scenario outcomes beyond a five-year time horizon given the number and unpredictability of variables. As a result, in our climate-related risk assessments, we include external predictions of demand, carbon pricing and comparison-pricing scenarios compared to our base-case pricing analysis, which we have projected out to 2040.

"USA_APA, 2023, APA US Sustainability Report",[b],123,eb4d2524f46da75d1a3c22e83409ea4d,"We include in our analysis the following IEA scenarios from the 2022 WEO report, which we compare against our internal APA base-case scenario the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) and the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS). We do not currently have a policy for zero and, therefore, did not use the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) scenario. Under the pricing scenarios considered, the third-party break-even prices referenced in each of APAs core areas of operation indicate the long-term potential for generating positive returns. "
"USA_APA, 2023, APA US Sustainability Report",[b],123,dd11a50c07233f8194bca5c77f8d24c0,"The STEPS reflects all current governmental carbon policies, assessed sector to sector. Under this scenario, carbon pricing is applied to the companys U.K. oil production only. For the 2021 STEPs, the IEA modified the 2020 scenario to reflect the higher demand for fossil fuel seen today, and it projects a leveling of demand after 2030. The 2022 STEPS shows a cumulative growth in world oil demand to 102 million Bbls of oil per day by 2030, and then remaining relatively flat through 2050. In the STEPS scenario, oil prices are shown to climb to 82 per IEA Bbl in 2030, and as demand levels off, the oil price rises to 95 per IEA Bbl in 2050. "
"USA_APA, 2023, APA US Sustainability Report",[b],123,1847b311ae2c78cb285db7950930a76d,"In contrast to STEPS, the APS projects lower demand for oil in 2050 compared to 2020. In the APS scenario, the decrease in oil demand corresponds to a decrease in oil price. "
"USA_APA, 2023, APA US Sustainability Report","[b, e]",123,02202b6ab47662843271847313e3837c,"The APS scenario reflects all countries announced climate commitments being met in full and on time, including nationally determined contributions. This scenario includes all announced net zero pledges, but still reflects gaps from the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement. The APS shows the highest impact of carbon pricing among the scenarios analyzed. In our analysis, carbon pricing is applied to the companys U.K. production in all years, while its U.S. and Egypt production is burdened only from 2030 onward. The APS represents the mid-case demand scenario, with demand remaining flat to slightly declining, to 93 million Bbls  per day, through 2030, then more rapidly declining to less than 57 million Bbls per day in 2050. The APS scenario predicts a more subdued price decline than does the NZE, with oil at 64 per IEA Bbl in 2030, and slowly sliding to 60 per IEA Bbl in 2050. "

Our 19-year average oil pricing, discounted for anticipated carbon constraints, is 43 per blended (West Texas Intermediate [WTI]Brent) Bbl. We believe our company is well positioned in any of the previously described scenarios. "
"USA_APA, 2023, APA US Sustainability Report",[b],124,cb3a22c60d3a160c34785c6db99e2bd5,"Our base-case scenario is an assessment of our business perspective, utilizing an internal oil pricing deck that builds in a carbon price based on the U.K. emissions trading scheme, such that our WTIBrent blended pricing accounts for the assumption of a carbon tax on U.K. Bbls. To account for the possibility of more aggressive regulation, a carbon tax is also being applied to U.S. Bbls. U.S. production in our base-case scenario is discounted at the same rate as in the STEPS scenario for U.K. Bbls. As defined by the IEAs WEO, Egypt is classified as an emerging market country with a developing economy therefore, no carbon pricing is assumed until 2030, escalating to 17tonne for Egypt production barrels in 2040. In our base-case scenario, our crude oil pricing assumption is a mixed WTIBrent blend at 53 per Bbl remaining flat until 2040. "
"USA_APA, 2023, APA US Sustainability Report",[j],124,4740feee3203c142edfd445e02b1ddf0,"The resilience of our approach can be seen in the results of our asset scenario-planning assessment, which compares projected break-even prices for our operating basins from third-party assessors (Wood Mackenzie and Enverus) to the average realized WTIBrent blend equivalent pricing for 20212040, from each of the three planning scenarios discussed above. In all three scenarios  including the APA base case, which burdens our U.S. production by a weighted-average carbon price borrowed from the STEPS case  the third-party break-even price is at a minimum 8 per Bbl less than the most conservative APS scenario prices. Again, our scenario-planning analysis positively supports that the break-even prices referenced in each of APAs core areas of operation indicate the long-term potential for generating positive returns.
