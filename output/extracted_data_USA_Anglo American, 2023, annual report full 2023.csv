We contrast this with the Wood Mackenzie Accelerated Energy Transition (AET) scenario which limits an increase in global warming to 1.5C. Our judgement is that these two scenarios cover the appropriate range of outcomes within  which to assess the impacts of transition risks. The Wood Mackenzie scenarios do not, however, include agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) developments and emissions. To account for this, we have supplemented the Wood Mackenzie forecasts with various scenario outlooks vetted by the IPCC for AFOLU. "

This is expected to be an interim step towards more comprehensive transportation decarbonisation  As intermittent renewable power generation accounts for an increasing share of power grids, hydrogen is a potential energy storage solution. PGMs will play a major role across the upstream, midstream and downstream segments of the hydrogen value chain. PGMs are required upstream for polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolysis the synthesis, dehydrogenation  and cracking in the midstream and the separation, purification and compression downstream  As FCEVs become necessary to decarbonise heavy-duty vehicles, demand for PGMs is expected to grow  Hybrid vehicles, which contain similar quantities of PGMs as ICE vehicles, are expected to play a role in the decarbonisation of vehicles, even in the longer term  An accelerated shift away from ICE vehicles towards BEVs poses a downside risk for PGMs which are contained in ICE catalytic converters and in FCEVs  Greater adoption of public transportation, ride sharing and other mobility levers could limit demand for personal vehicles  As reforestation efforts grow, available land for crop development will decrease, leading to an increase in fertiliser use to improve crop yield  Increasing efforts to decrease emissions from farming  Polyhalite may also support efficient use of nitrogen fertilisers to reduce excess nitrous oxide soil emissions, as well as reverse the degradation of soil and the resultant carbon emissions. All else being equal, the lower carbon nature of polyhalite may justify a price premium over higher emission alternatives  Across scenarios, there is high uncertainty related to future consumer behaviours and attitudes to diamond jewellery as well as historical cyclicity in demand, although we expect carbon neutral diamond producers, such as De Beers, to benefit from evolving consumer preferences. However, these factors are not directly influenced by the differences across the scenarios. Due to this, we believe that the net impact on rough diamond demand is likely to be immaterial across scenarios  Short to medium Short to long Medium to long Long Neutral Key Risk Opportunity Short term  05 years Medium term  515 years Long term  15 years  The evolution of the industry sectors our products serve could create risks and opportunities for our portfolio. Similarly, the technological developments that underpin the transition of each sector could also present risks and opportunities for our products. For example, the speed and technology mix of the transition towards low carbon vehicles  specifically, the mix of BEVs, FCEVs and hybrid vehicles  will impact the outlook for the PGMs we produce.
