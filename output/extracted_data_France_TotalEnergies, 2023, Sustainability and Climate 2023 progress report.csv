Keeping global warming well below 2C, in line with the Paris Agreement, requires that we drastically reduce consumption of fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) and make the world energy system evolve by building the new lowcarbon energy system at a much faster pace. Our collective challenge  which became evident in 2022  is to reconcile the energy transition with the need for energy security and concerns over its cost. "
