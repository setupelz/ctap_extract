Scenarios based on current and announced policies indicate fossil fuels will continue to be an important part of the global energy mix for years to come, while the adoption of alternate energy sources progresses. Presently around 80 of total energy supply comes from oil, coal and natural gas according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). "

The remainder of the coal we produce is used in the manufacture of steel internationally or domestic power generation in Australia and South Africa. We believe coals share of primary energy demand will decline over time, but for many countries it continues to drive economic and social development. Our energy portfolio, including coal, helps provide the products needed to meet the energy and development needs of today.

Glencores scenarios were developed in 2020, drawing principally, though not exclusively, on the IEA scenarios available at the time. The next update will be in 2023 as part of our climate strategic review. For these 2022 price sensitivities, we have drawn from the IEAs latest World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO 2022) climate scenarios, described below  IEAs Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) (WEO 2022 prices)  the impact of existing policy frameworks and announced policy intentions, subject to the IEAs assessment of the likelihood of such ambitions being implemented (reflecting an updated outlook consistent with our Current Pathway scenario)  IEAs Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) (WEO 2022 prices)  the impact of all major national announcements of 2030 targets and longer term net zero and other pledges, regardless of whether these have been anchored in legislation or nationally determined contributions   IEAs Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) (WEO 2022 prices)  a pathway for the global energy sector to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 (reflecting an updated outlook consistent with our Radical Transformation scenario).

"Switzerland_Glencore, 2022, Annual Report",[b],170,8139eca38ab5074b75ff2e54e6e36704,The IEA no longer publishes assumptions relating to the Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS). 
"Switzerland_Glencore, 2022, Annual Report",[b],170,f0d56f0a5b8f62cb9993aef0e9186098,"The STEPS, APS and NZE sensitivity prices adopted are those included in the documentation to WEO 2022, except that IEA thermal coal prices are on a delivered basis. These have been adjusted to FOB pricing on the basis of forward freight costs. Furthermore, in determining the Colombian FOB price, we have used a weighting of the IEA Japan and IEA European prices to take into account that Colombian coal sold from Cerrejn is likely to be delivered to a combination of different markets in the future as coal demand in Europe declines.

"Switzerland_Glencore, 2022, Annual Report",[b],170,80eee5e09dccd517a858f7fd265c395b,"The IEA assumes, in each scenario, additional decarbonisation measures leading to declining fossil fuel prices by the years 2030 and 2050, anchored in each case in a 2021 baseline. For the purpose of our climate change sensitivities below, we have assumed linear progression of prices between these points. Our base case reflects higher longer-term prices than in each of the IEAs climate scenarios reflecting our assessment of the supply and demand outlook and the industry cost structure. "
"Switzerland_Glencore, 2022, Annual Report",[b],171,d44ec04fc67efeccbb8351579098299d,"The prior year disclosure illustrated impairments under each of the IEAs scenarios, whereas the above table reflects impairments only in the NZE scenario (for Australia and South Africa) and the APS (for South Africa only). This mainly reflects materially higher shorter term prices in the various scenarios. "
"Switzerland_Glencore, 2022, Annual Report",[b],171,20f282368b1f68376b2186a03d052e46,"No impairment is projected for Cerrejn using any of the IEAs scenarios, given that the current mine plan reflects expiry of mining leases by 2034, meaning the mine would not be exposed to the lower prices at the longer end of the price curves.
