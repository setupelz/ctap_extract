In September 2022, our subsidiary 1PointFive began construction on our first Direct Air Capture (DAC) plant in Ector County, Texas. With a planned capacity of 500,000 metric tons, this DAC plant will be the worlds largest of its kind and is expected to begin commercial operations in 2025. 1PointFive has executed agreements to sell carbon dioxide (CO2) removal credits from our DAC plant to prospective purchasers in diverse industry sectors. As of March 2023, 1PointFive has also secured substantial pore space and land in multiple locations along the U.S. Gulf Coast and in the Permian Basin for carbon sequestration hubs to store captured CO2 from DAC and industrial facilities.

If this market does not develop, or if the regulatory environment does not support carbon management activities, Occidental may not be successful in entering this industry. "
"USA_Occidental Petroleum, 2022, annual report 2022",[n],33,afb092a527039271991b8b73dd189fe8,"Occidental seeks to meet its sustainability and environmental goals through its development and commercialization of technologies that lower both GHG emissions from industrial processes and existing atmospheric concentrations of CO2. Occidental believes that carbon removal technologies, including DAC and CCUS, can, with incentives necessary for their development and deployment, provide essential CO2 reductions to assist the worlds transition to a less carbon-intensive economy. During 2022, Occidental undertook the following actions, among others, toward advancing its low-carbon strategy  Achieved zero routine flaring of gas across its U.S. oil and gas operations, 8 years ahead of the World Banks 2030 target  Reduced estimated methane emissions by 33 from the 2020 baseline  Began construction activities for DAC 1 in the Permian  Acquired interests in approximately 265,000 net acres of pore space access along the U.S. Gulf Coast and  Invested approximately 530 million in low-carbon businesses, technologies, and net-zero pathway advancements, including the aforementioned pore space.
