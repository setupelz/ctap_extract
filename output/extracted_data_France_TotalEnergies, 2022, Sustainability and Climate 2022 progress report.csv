Our Analysis of the IEAs NZE Scenario  The IEAs Net Zero Emissions (NZE) Scenario is a normative scenario that describes a changing world energy demand that would be consistent with limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C without overshooting the related carbon budget.

The IEA specifies that the NZE Scenario is shaped by numerous uncertainties, including the speed with which demand and behaviors adapt, the real level of energy efficiency, the pace at which new decarbonization technologies such as hydrogen and CCS scale up, etc. "
"France_TotalEnergies, 2022, Sustainability and Climate 2022 progress report",[b],8,0570bf5ad69f8fd7638a3f63bb0e7c90,"While we share the normative scenarios vision for the energy mix in 2050, the trajectory mapped out for demand between 2020 and 2030 is undeniably at odds with current trends. This applies to demand for energy overall, and to demand for oil, gas and coal. The IEAs own short- and long-term forecasts, published since May 2021, do not in any way support the assumptions of the NZE scenario. Demand for coal in 2021 exceeded 2019 levels, and the IEA expects an increase of 0.5 a year between now and 2024. According to its latest forecasts, demand for oil should be higher in 2022 than in 2019. And worldwide gas demand increased by 4 in 2021, with the IEA expecting a 2 rise in 2022. The NZE Scenario requires more than 1000 GW of new solar and wind capacity to be deployed each year between 2020 and 2030, which is four times as much as the 250 GW added in 2020. "
"France_TotalEnergies, 2022, Sustainability and Climate 2022 progress report",[b],8,efa50c91645f81cb1b8f80418fc011c2,The highly demanding assumptions used for the trend in energy demand up to 2030 have led the IEA to affirm that the world no longer needs any new oil and gas projects because the natural field depletion of around 4 a year is in line with the modeled decline in oil consumption. 
"France_TotalEnergies, 2022, Sustainability and Climate 2022 progress report",[b],8,f7e3dc19aa04cacd881e6449cfc4e93c,"Conversely, an excessively sharp decline in oil and gas supply in an environment where demand is not adjusted accordingly would, of course, lead to higher prices. With this in mind, it should be noted that the current level of investment in upstream oil and gas is below the level modeled by the IEA in the NZE Scenario for 2022-2030 (320 billion and 350 billion in 2020 and 2021 versus 366 billion a year in the NZE Scenario).
