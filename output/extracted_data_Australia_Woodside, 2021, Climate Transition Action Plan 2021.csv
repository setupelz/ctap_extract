These scenarios are not predictions  the IEA does not have a single view on the future of the energy system. In contrast to the 2020 edition of the WEO, it does not vary the assumptions about public health and economic recovery implications across the scenarios. The scenarios are The Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) shows a narrow but achievable pathway for the global energy sector to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050, with advanced economies reaching net zero emissions in advance of others. This scenario also meets key energy-related United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular achieving universal energy access by 2030. The NZE does not rely on emissions reductions from outside the energy sector to achieve its goals, but assumes that non-energy emissions will be reduced in the same proportion as energy emissions. It is consistent with limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C without a temperature overshoot (with a 50 probability). The Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) is a well below 2C pathway, and represents a gateway to achieving the outcomes targeted by the Paris Agreement. The SDS assumes all energy-related SDGs are met, all current net zero pledges are achieved in full, and there are increased efforts to realise near-term emissions reductions advanced economies reach net zero emissions by 2050, China around 2060, and all other countries by 2070 at the latest. Without assuming extensive net negative emissions, this scenario is consistent with limiting the global temperature rise to 1.65C (with a 50 probability). With some level of net negative emissions after 2070, the temperature rise could be reduced to 1.5C in 2100. The Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) takes account of all of the climate commitments made by governments around the world, including Nationally Determined Contributions as well as longer term net zero targets, and assumes that they will be met in full and on time. The global trends in this scenario represent the cumulative extent of the worlds ambition to tackle climate change as of mid-2021. The remaining difference in global emissions between the APS and the goals in the NZE or the Sustainable Development Scenario shows the ambition gap that needs to be closed to achieve the goals agreed in the Paris Agreement in 2015. The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) does not take for granted that governments will reach all announced goals. Instead, the STEPS explores where the energy system might go without additional policy implementation. As with the APS, it is not designed to achieve a particular outcome. It takes a granular, sector-by-sector look at existing policies and measures and those under development. The remaining difference in global emissions between the STEPS and the APS, represents the implementation gap that needs to be closed for countries to achieve their announced decarbonisation targets.

Woodside used interpolation techniques to estimate Brent annual price points in between the years that the IEA disclosed price points for (which are real terms 2020). For gas pricing assumptions all non-contracted LNG volumes were assessed at IEAs Japan import price, as a proxy for North Asian LNG spot price. Woodside used interpolation techniques to estimate annual gas price points in between the years that the IEA disclosed prices for (which are real terms 2020). For oil linked LNG contracts, prices are derived from the Brent forecasts and the terms of the contracts. "

The IEA only provide carbon prices from 2030 onwards. As a result, Woodside used a 2020 average Australian regulatory carbon price to derive a starting price point of US11.51 t CO2-e RT2022. Woodside used the 2020 starting price point and the IEAs published 2030 and 2040 carbon prices for each scenario to interpolate annual price points through to 2040. "

The forward looking statements in this report reflect expectations held at the date of this report and scenario analysis undertaken by Woodside. There are inherent limitations with scenario analysis, including the limitations set out on page 23 of this report, and it is difficult to predict which, if any, of the scenarios might eventuate. Scenario analysis relies on assumptions that may or may not be, or prove to be, correct and that may or may not eventuate and scenarios may also be impacted by additional factors to the assumptions disclosed. As part of its scenario analysis, Woodside has used climate scenarios published in the IEAs 2021 World Energy Outlook. The TCFD Guidance on Scenario Analysis for Non-Financial Companies (on page 66) describes limitations and uncertainties associated with the use of the IEA scenarios, while also noting the benefits, including that the IEA scenarios are widely used and accepted.1  Woodside does not undertake to provide ongoing market updates on the plan to achieve its objective or targets, or performance against the plan, except to the extent it has a legal obligation to do so.
