This first analysis considered the market and regulatory risks most likely to materialize and were evaluated under the three scenarios of the World Energy Outlook 2022 of the International Energy Agency (IEA) (i) Net Zero Emissions (NZE), (ii) Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), and (iii) Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS).

In the APS and STEPS scenarios, the oil business shows resilience to volatility. However, this exercise cannot be considered as absolute, as the IEA scenarios do not consider the dynamics of local energy demand, especially in the natural gas market. "

Currently, Ecopetrol estimates that about 30 of the reduction by 2030 will be leveraged by offsetting through Natural Climate Solutions projects. This percentage could be diminished according to the guidelines established by SBTi or other similar initiatives. If the accepted percentage decreases, other abatement technologies will be required, which will increase operating costs. "

Under a Business-as-Usual scenario and a horizon to 2100, the greatest threats across the entire asset portfolio correspond to the increase in maximum temperatures and the duration of heat waves. This is one of the most significant risks in terms of worker safety and operational disruptions. However, it is not expected to have a direct impact on infrastructure. In addition, six locations have a substantially increased risk of coastal flooding, while more moderate river flooding is expected at four locations. The remaining climate hazards are not expected to increase substantially across the asset portfolio. "
