"USA_Marathon Oil, 2022, Sustainability Report",[e],7,d599ee1031e8a0cb83f20a9d6937738c,"Our risk-based capital allocation strategy is designed to ensure strict capital discipline and long-term competitive returns for our shareholders. We require higher return-on-investment (ROI) thresholds for projects with greater financial and regulatory uncertainty than those with more stable cash flow and lower regulatory risk. The ROI thresholds are highest for refining investments. This has the effect of a de facto carbon price because refining projects, with the highest carbon exposure, must overcome a much higher minimum rate of return than, for instance, investments in our MPLX natural gas GP business, with lower carbon exposure. Projects are also individually evaluated against our long-term price forecast, which considers the demand projections from various Paris aligned scenarios in alignment with our climate-related targets. This process has contributed to the significant shift in our manufacturing outputs. "
