"USA_Marathon Oil, 2022, Sustainability Report",[k],7,08eb8a2afcddcf7dda5d08605724131f,"MPCs Scope 3 GHG emissions reduction target covers Category 11 Use of Sold Products, which entail more than 70 of our total calculated Scope 3 GHG emissions. Informed by guidance from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and Ipieca, the target is based on refined product yields, as these represent larger emissions than our marketed volumes. "
"USA_Marathon Oil, 2022, Sustainability Report",[e],7,d599ee1031e8a0cb83f20a9d6937738c,"Our risk-based capital allocation strategy is designed to ensure strict capital discipline and long-term competitive returns for our shareholders. We require higher return-on-investment (ROI) thresholds for projects with greater financial and regulatory uncertainty than those with more stable cash flow and lower regulatory risk. The ROI thresholds are highest for refining investments. This has the effect of a de facto carbon price because refining projects, with the highest carbon exposure, must overcome a much higher minimum rate of return than, for instance, investments in our MPLX natural gas GP business, with lower carbon exposure. Projects are also individually evaluated against our long-term price forecast, which considers the demand projections from various Paris aligned scenarios in alignment with our climate-related targets. This process has contributed to the significant shift in our manufacturing outputs. "

The CO2 generated in an industrial process is captured, compressed and transported to permanent storage deep underground. CCS can be used to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors such as petroleum refining and the manufacture of chemicals, steel, and cement. In April 2022, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reaffirmed the vital role CCS has in achieving global climate goals and encouraged governments to set clear CCS policies to advance its deployment.
