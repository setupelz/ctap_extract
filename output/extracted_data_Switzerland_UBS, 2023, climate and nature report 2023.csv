The framework is based on the Net Zero Asset Managers initiatives guidance on assets committed to be managed in line with attaining net-zero emissions by 2050 or earlier, as well as guidance from other industry bodies. From this we have derived the following guiding principles when defining an investment portfolio as having a net-zero ambition  The portfolio has a defined decarbonization target, a commitment to increasing portfolio coverage of SBTi-verified targets andor invests in climate solutions that enable net-zero global GHG emissions by 2050.

Portfolio target levels are expressed in terms of interim milestones or an annualized decarbonization rate (absolute or intensity) and reference a relevant science-based net-zero pathway (currently defined in relevant climate models as 1.5C). Targets are set using scope 1 and 2 emissions, with the inclusion of scope 3 guided by the availability of quality data and regulatory requirements. Decarbonization can be achieved through various approaches depending on the strategy. Some examples include tracking a relevant index that follows a net-zero pathway, actively managing the portfolio carbon profile against a relevant benchmark and managing carbon reduction to a specified pathway. During 2023, we also introduced the industry-accepted Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) verification of corporate targets as an additional indicator of net-zero alignment. "

We are accelerating the switch from fossil fuel heating systems to heat pumps or district heating in our real estate and refurbishing our buildings to make them more energy-efficient. In addition, we purchase renewable electricity through recognized instruments (RECs, vPPA, PPA). Our second priority is ensuring that we have enough high-quality carbon removal certificates available from 2025 onward to neutralize the residual emissions1. Our focus here is on technology solutions, as we want to ensure that the captured CO2 is permanently stored. To this end we opted in 2022 to contract more than 80,000 metric tons of carbon removal. "
