"UK_Shell, 2022, shell energy transition progress report 2022",[k],3,3f740a1dc1a4ad8ae2f785c18a89c883,Other investors told us they would like Shell to introduce medium-term targets to reduce absolute Scope 3 emissions produced by customers when they use our products. The Board has considered setting a Scope 3 absolute emissions target but has found it would be against the financial interests of our shareholders and would not help to mitigate global warming.

By the end of 2022, the net carbon intensity of the energy products sold by Shell had fallen by 3.8, compared with 2016. Our analysis, using data from the International Energy Agency, shows the net carbon intensity of the global energy system fell by around 2 over that time [A]. "

"UK_Shell, 2022, shell energy transition progress report 2022","[a, e]",12,1f738140dd2b62e490f9fab417f4db9e,"[A] Shells net carbon intensity is the average intensity, weighted by sales volume, of the energy products sold by Shell. It is tracked, measured and reported using our Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) methodology  Shells target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. We also have short-, medium- and long-term targets to reduce our carbon intensity, measured using our net carbon intensity metric. We believe these targets are aligned with a 1.5C pathway derived from the scenarios used in the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5C (SR 1.5), most of which show the global energy system reaching net zero between 2040 and 2060.

"UK_Shell, 2022, shell energy transition progress report 2022","[a, e]",13,12c5c152906318494d18e1ab02b1a1e2,"There is no established standard for aligning an energy suppliers decarbonisation targets with the temperature limit goal of the Paris Agreement. In the absence of a broadly accepted standard, we have developed our own approach for demonstrating Paris alignment by setting carbon intensity targets within a pathway derived from the IPCC SR 1.5 scenarios. This pathway is aligned with the more ambitious temperature goal of the Paris Agreement to limit global average temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels by 2100. "
"UK_Shell, 2022, shell energy transition progress report 2022",[d],13,ff74ef5627644a62636b7442ccfdfe6d,"When constructing the pathway, we started by filtering out certain scenarios to ensure that Shells targets are aligned with earlier action and low-overshoot scenarios. Overshoot refers to the extent to which a scenario exceeds an emissions budget and subsequently relies on sinks to compensate for the excess emissions. Next, we calculated the carbon intensity (grammes of CO2MJ of energy) for each of the remaining scenarios by dividing net emissions by total final energy consumption, with electricity represented as a fossil fuel equivalent. "
"UK_Shell, 2022, shell energy transition progress report 2022",[a],13,928d461c914721dde618f412a23fb4b3,"To set a starting point, we then indexed the resulting carbon intensities to a common value of 100 in 2016 to remove the impact of differences between Shells historical net carbon intensity and the intensities calculated from the IPCC scenarios. Finally, the pathway was constructed using the range of carbon intensity reductions over time. Outlying values at the top and bottom of the range were removed, which had the effect of narrowing the final pathway. "
"UK_Shell, 2022, shell energy transition progress report 2022",[e],13,62b18a383cd01fb7bc6f904dd724af90,"By using the 1.5C pathway produced by this approach to set our targets, we aligned them with the necessary reduction in carbon intensity shown in the 1.5C scenarios. This is illustrated in the table, which shows that our targets are positioned within the range of the 1.5C pathway. The upper and lower limits represent the upper and lower boundaries of the 1.5C pathway derived using the approach described above. "
"UK_Shell, 2022, shell energy transition progress report 2022","[e, l]",13,5afe382ca89c32fdc5c0c9f6ee5eafc2,"Until 2035, our calculation of the total net emissions of each scenario includes only the expected mitigation actions by Shell, such as carbon capture and storage and offsetting using natural sinks. Any use of offsets included in the carbon-neutral energy products we offer our customers is also part of our calculation. After that date, we include mitigation actions taken separately by our customers. This is because we expect that customers will need to take action to mitigate their emissions from the use of our products if society is to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. "
"UK_Shell, 2022, shell energy transition progress report 2022","[k, l]",13,36560cf2f83aa6631d7d2d27dac8e762,"To account for reductions in emissions across full energy value chains it is necessary to build new protocols to include mitigation actions by both energy suppliers and users. Currently, energy suppliers report the Scope 3 emissions from the use of their products, which are equivalent to the Scope 1 emissions reported by the users of those products. However, when users of energy products mitigate their Scope 1 emissions by the use of carbon capture and storage or offsets there is no protocol for reflecting a corresponding reduction in the Scope 3 emissions reported by the energy supplier. We will continue to engage stakeholders on these carbon protocols and will seek to align with new frameworks as they evolve. "

We believe that this target is aligned with a 1.5C pathway derived from the IPCC SR 1.5 scenarios. We also believe that the pace of change will vary around the world by region and by sector, taking into consideration the time needed for energy users to invest in large-scale equipment, and the energy infrastructure changes needed for Shell to deliver more low- and zero-carbon energy.

As we wait for the outcome of the appeal, we are taking active steps to comply with the ruling. We believe the actions we are taking to deliver our energy transition strategy are consistent with the court ruling and its end of 2030 timeline. This includes the investments we are making in low-carbon fuels, renewable power, and hydrogen in addition to making changes to our upstream and refinery portfolios. "
