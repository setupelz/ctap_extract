Each one of these is an important signpost to follow to gauge the pace of the energy transition. Consider the growth of low-carbon power. In the NZE scenario, the IEA assumes that 100 of power generated across the world will be low-carbon, compared with about 9 currently. Under current policy, reflected by the Outlook and STEPS, the figures are 69 and 79 respectively. That still represents significant growth, but it is far lower than the increase assumed by the IEA in the NZE scenario. "
