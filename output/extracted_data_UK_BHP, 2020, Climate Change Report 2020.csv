Using these scenarios, a science-based target for BHP can be developed by applying the same rate of reduction to BHPs emissions as the rate at which the worlds emissions would have to contract in order to meet the relevant goal (known as the absolute contraction method). Based on our analysis, our medium-term target of at least 30 per cent reduction by FY2030 against FY2020 levels (18) falls within the range of emissions reductions required in this timeframe to be considered aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement.
