To this end, we set for ourselves the ambitious target of reaching net zero for our own direct emissions by 2040 (scope 1 and 2) aligned with a 1.5 pathway, 10 years earlier than required under the Paris Climate Agreement. This will involve changing our own processes and activities towards increasing the use of renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, boosting the circularity of processes through the reuse and recycling of materials. On the other hand, we want to contribute to the decarbonization of the sector, by leveraging infrastructures that make the transition towards a low carbon mobility possible (e.g. electric mobility, alternative fuels, new transport modes), by implementing solutions that facilitate the exchange between transport modes for people and goods, by leveraging digital technology solutions and thus making mobility smarter, safer, seamless and sustainable.

This choice goes in the direction of analyzing a situation under less protective conditions in case of global policies adopted do not lead to expected benefits or lead to limited positive impacts. Furthermore, a best-case analysis under RCP 2.6 scenario is underway. "

Any risk exceeding the related appetite level is reported to the CEO, Control  Risk Committee and BoD, and constantly monitored. In order to bring these risks within the related level of risk appetite, it is required to implement corrective actions. ERM Model  On November 11, 2021, the Board of Directors, with the favorable advice of the Sustainability Committee, approved an ambitious multi-year plan to reduce emissions by setting interim science-based targets with the goal of achieving zero direct emissions by 2040 or earlier. Mundys committed to the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) and submitted its targets. According to information provided by the SBTi, review of such target is expected to take place in the second half of 2022. "

To achieve the 2040 net-zero ambition, by 2030 we aim to reduce by 50 our 2019 direct emissions, which accounted for approximately 245.000 tons of CO2e13. About 57 are related to emissions from fossil fuel for stationary and mobile sources and 43 are related to electricity and thermal energy consumption to operate our assets. This absolute reduction target follows a trajectory consistent with the Science Based Target initiative for the 1.5C scenario and put us on a pathway to fullfil our commitment to be net-zero by 2040, 10 years earlier than the objectives of the Paris Agreement.
