"Canada_Teck Resources, 2023, Sustainability Report Climate Change",[k],4,c71fe3d98b436aa41cedff3e2db75212,"We recognize that, to achieve global GHG reductions that limit climate change to 1.5C, action will be required not only by Teck but also within our value chain. Our (<httpswww.teck.commediaTeck-Climate-Change-Policy.pdf>)Climate (<httpswww.teck.commediaTeck-Climate-Change-Policy.pdf>)Change Policy includes a commitment to work with our customers and transportation providers to reduce emissions downstream of our business. We have set an ambition to achieve net-zero Scope 3 emissions by 2050, supported by interim goals targeting 2030, aligning Teck with the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) position statement on accelerating action on Scope 3 GHG emissions.

"Canada_Teck Resources, 2023, Sustainability Report Climate Change",[k],6,f79e6997b0d0b98b31928a56c4d23db6,"In 2023, Teck completed construction and began operation of a Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) pilot project at Trail Operations. The pilot plant is expected to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) from the Acid Plant flue gas at a rate of 1 tonne per day. The project will also evaluate options for the utilization andor storage of the captured CO2  at Trail Operations. If successful, the project could be scaled up to an industrial CCUS plant with the potential to capture over 100,000 tonnes of CO2 per year at Trail Operations. Our pilot technical learnings will also be shared with our value chain partners, supporting our Scope 3 ambition of working with our customers to reduce the carbon intensity of steelmaking. "
"Canada_Teck Resources, 2023, Sustainability Report Climate Change",[e],7,46b3e3f542fd6a37fc5ec90460059af4,"We engage policy-makers in all jurisdictions in which we operate andor have major projects, as well as other jurisdictions through our membership in various industry associations, such as the ICMM and the Mining Association of Canada (MAC). We also review industry association positions on climate change and advocate for their alignment with the Paris Agreement. Across the associations of which Teck is a member, ICMM, MAC and the Mining Association of British Columbia (MABC) are the trade associations that have the greatest amount of engagement on climate action. All three associations have positions aligned with the Paris Agreement. Our climate advocacy and industry collaborations were published in our first-ever (<httpswww.teck.commediaIndustry-Associations-Review-2021-22.pdf>)Industry Associations Review last year, which reviews our industrys climate change positions and actions.

"Canada_Teck Resources, 2023, Sustainability Report Climate Change",[d],7,abaa1e52112329a08d93a8bb3bf2cadd,"Our (<httpswww.teck.commediaTeckClimateChangeOutlook2021.pdf>)Climate Change Outlook 2021 report looks at how Teck is positioned for a low-carbon economy by analyzing potential business risks and opportunities under three different climate change scenarios. These scenarios provide information on how Teck is analyzing and preparing for the risks and opportunities that may emerge as the global community combats climate change and moves to a lower-carbon future. This report builds on our 2018 and 2019 Portfolio Resilience in the Face of Climate Change reports and aligns with recommendations from the Task  Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which we support. We report our emissions data annually to the (<httpswww.cdp.neten>)CDP and we engage with Climate Action 100 and other investor organizations. Tecks 2023 CDP response is available on (<httpswww.teck.commediaCDP-Disclosures.pdf>)our website. "
"Canada_Teck Resources, 2023, Sustainability Report Climate Change",[a],7,af5917351c42d72f221bb2e0b44df052,"In 2023, to support the identification and assessment of risks related to the physical impacts of climate change, we procured relevant climate change projection data from the most current global climate model data available  CMIP6  for our operations, portions of our logistics corridors, and  select projects and legacy properties. CMIP6 is the latest phase of collaboration under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). The data is scientifically robust and provides the foundation for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes Sixth Assessment Reports. The data sets include time horizons for the near-future (2030s), mid-century (2050s) and end-of-century (2080s) for two of the future climate scenarios proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes Sixth Assessment Report a scenario with moderate emissions (SSP2-4.5) and a scenario with the highest concentration of CO2.

"Canada_Teck Resources, 2023, Sustainability Report Climate Change","[i, j]",7,bb2e29b28700921816bed4bfc89ffee8,"Our logistics chains are particularly exposed to climate hazards. In 2023, we undertook a climate change vulnerability assessment with a qualified third party to model potential disruptions or limitations to the logistics route for our steelmaking coal based on different future climate change scenarios. The vulnerability and impact assessment identified potential instances of more or fewer exceedances of climate thresholds and determined the total impact on logistics downtime across different climate change scenarios. The analysis will be used to inform risk management actions and mitigation strategies moving forward, supporting our efforts to make our operations resilient to the physical risks of climate change.
