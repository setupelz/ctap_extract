"USA_Devon Energy, 2023, Sustainability Report",[i],17,ca4f42430f09f067d4a6b2fa50597afe,"Assessing and reporting our climate change-related risks Climate change-related risks receive formal and ongoing consideration in Devons enterprise risk management process. The company regularly models numerous regional and macro-level scenarios  including acquisitions, divestitures and changes in regulations and market conditions  to test the strength of our portfolio and resources. Each year, the modeled scenarios inform the strategic decision-making of Devons executive committee and board of directors that factors into Devons long-range plan. We publicly report on climate-related risks and the results of our climate-related scenario analysis in our Climate Change Assessment Report (CCAR) in an effort to demonstrate our ongoing commitment to transparency.

Devon retained ICF to help assess the companys market risk and our oil and natural gas portfolios resilience in the face of potential impacts of climate policy on oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids (NGL) demand, production and prices, as well as basin-level exposure to potential physical risks from a rapidly changing climate. In order to evaluate the potential market risks to the companys portfolio from a possible carbon-constrained future, Devon evaluated pricing scenarios and model results from both ICF and the widely referenced International Energy Agency (IEA), including the IEAs 2022 World Energy Outlook (WEO) Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, which targets a 1.5C stabilization in the rise in global average temperatures.

The climate projections were based on scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). "
"USA_Devon Energy, 2023, Sustainability Report",[d],18,d7689a1e6ad4e3c68ed6ab256081345d,"In addition, Devon retained ClimeCo to enhance the companys alignment to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), an international, multi-industry led initiative launched to develop recommendations for voluntary disclosure of climate-related risk. The 2023 CCAR includes additional metrics and disclosures corresponding to the TCFDs updated 2021 implementation guidance, demonstrating our support for the ongoing efforts of the TCFD. "
"USA_Devon Energy, 2023, Sustainability Report",j,18,699e8e0ea68758643f675592ea137dd3,"Under carbon-constrained future scenarios, demand for oil and natural gas is substantially reduced. However, even in such carbon-constrained scenarios, oil and natural gas remain crucial to meeting global energy demand and North American oil and natural gas production plays a large role in meeting that demand.

"USA_Devon Energy, 2023, Sustainability Report",[d],46,5956b2f128c5ed6db86c2bca11afca01,"To demonstrate our commitment to transparency and reporting, we published Climate Change Assessment Reports in 2018, 2020, 2021 and 2023. The 2023 report is consistent with the core elements of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework. We seek to align with TCFD because many of our investors and other stakeholders prefer this international, multi-industry-led initiative for voluntary disclosure of climate-related risk. We continue to share our tactics to meet our decarbonization targets, as well as information about our water use, biodiversity, land reclamation and other environmental topics. "
