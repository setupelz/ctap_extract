Rapidly reducing our own emissions is necessary but not sufficient. To be an effective agent of change in the energy transition, we must help society decarbonise by providing our customers and end-users with energy that has lower  and eventually net-zero  emissions. To achieve this, we have a clear plan to apply our experience and competence from oil and gas to new sectors of the energy system. We will generate strong cashflow from a highly focused, carbon efficient oil and gas business to fund our transformation. We will continue to scale up our investments in renewables to create value from our existing portfolio and a high-quality project pipeline. We are developing and deploying the industrial value chains of the future in hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS) to enable other industries to decarbonise their activities. In parallel, we will continue to work with our suppliers and customers, host governments, and civil society to develop the business models, policies and frameworks to enable the world to achieve net zero by 2050.

We are pleased to present this plan here. It integrates key elements of our decarbonisation strategy with relevant actions and ambitions. It includes information on capital allocation, policy engagement, risk and performance frameworks, and other enablers to deliver on our ambitions. The plan builds on our 50 years experience, our strategy and strong track-record. It is informed by science, stakeholder engagement, and an acknowledgement of the changing set of expectations of companies in a carbon constrained world. It draws on scenarios from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as well as investor-group frameworks, including the Climate Action 100 Net Zero Company Benchmark.

We aim for 90 of these reductions to be met by absolute reductions. By setting a baseline year that corresponds to the year of the Paris Agreement, we can chart our emissions reduction progress according to a Paris-defined pathway. Such a baseline also enables us to show our early action on emissions reduction and to build on our leadership position throughout this decade. Equinors 2030 ambition for group-wide operated emissions is aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement and what IPCC scenarios show as being consistent with a 1.5 degree pathway. It is also aligned with the Norwegian states ambition for emission reductions from the oil and gas industry with a 2005 baseline. "
"Equinor_Equinor, 2022, energy transition plan",[l],12,d47165acf0e06b6787d9e88d72d6220c,"We have already made significant reductions  nearly half of the reductions needed  through a combination of portfolio optimisation and energy efficiency measures. Reaching the 2030 ambition will require a focussed and coordinated effort across the company on executing and maturing abatement projects, improving energy efficiency of offshore and onshore assets and strengthening resilience in the portfolio, including through consolidation. The abatement projects primarily include electrification of offshore assets in Norway, mainly by power from shore. Offsets will play a minimal role in achieving this ambition. However, in the longer term, we see negative emissions solutions and offsets as making an important contribution to address the climate challenge. We plan to use only credits verified according to high standards and to disclose information about the type of offsets employed. To ensure quality in our credits, we have established a set of corporate criteria and principles based on the Oxford Principles for Net Zero Aligned Carbon Offsetting. "

These energy sources will be needed to power the global economy for many years to come, including in every independent scenario of what would be needed for a Paris-aligned trajectory. In addition to being primary sources of energy, oil and gas will also be needed as input to low carbon fuels for hard-to-abate sectors such as blue hydrogen and as feedstocks for non-energy applications such as chemicals. To meet the needs of society, Equinor will continue to produce oil and gas for the foreseeable future.

Equity share  Hydrogen and ammonia versatile enablers of the transition  Hydrogen offers a low and zero-carbon solution to sectors that are technically difficult to decarbonise, such as heavy industries including steel and cement and transport sectors such as heavy duty trucking, shipping and aviation. Because of its versatility, most credible low carbon scenarios include significant deployment of hydrogen. Pursuing a technology-neutral approach to hydrogen development will enable the fastest and most cost-efficient decarbonisation across sectors and regions. To this end, we aim to supply hydrogen to 3-5 major industrial clusters by 2035, aiming at a 10 market share of clean hydrogen in Europe. We plan to realise these ambitions through a portfolio of hydrogen projects, centred in industrial clusters in Norway, Northwest continental Europe, the UK and the US. We have made considerable progress on some of our key projects and added several new ones, including the H2BE project for low carbon hydrogen production in Belgium and an initiative to develop a low carbon and hydrogen industrial region in the tri-state area in the US. As we execute on our strategy of providing hydrogen and CO management services to large industrial clusters, we retain significant optionality across decarbonisation segments and geographies. "
