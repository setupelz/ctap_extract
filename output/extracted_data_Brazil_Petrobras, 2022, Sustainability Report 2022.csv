"Brazil_Petrobras, 2022, Sustainability Report 2022",[e],32,dbcb08e46efc1a64da38a35fae2aa002,"The Paris Agreement calls for a profound reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and a transformation of the energy supply. Our scenarios point to an unequivocal energy transition, with an uncertain pace. Changes are already being observed in the energy markets, such as the consolidation of the mobility electrification trend and the cost reduction and expansion of the scale of modern renewable energy production and energy storage. "

"Brazil_Petrobras, 2022, Sustainability Report 2022",[e],49,0cf65015f0e9fe60e3ab922416f834b3,"3 Our ambition refers to emissions within Brazilian territory, where more than 97 of our operational emissions occur. For the other emissions, we also aim for neutrality within a period compatible with the Paris Agreement, in line with local commitments and international organizations. "
"Brazil_Petrobras, 2022, Sustainability Report 2022",[l],97,4b6075ff31aad5a4c030dcd4b1764035,"2 Petrobras is committed to maintaining the level of emissions in 2030 in relation to 2022 when we consider the emissions related to the average thermoelectric dispatch of the last 5 years in this years projection. Petrobras commitment is to not exceed 54.8 million tons of CO2 in 2030, unless there is a strong demand for electricity generation from thermal plants due to national water stress events. Achieving this commitment considers the possibility of using carbon credits as a complementary strategy and depends on actions to gain efficiency and divestments provided for in SP 2023-27. "
"Brazil_Petrobras, 2022, Sustainability Report 2022",[k],116,0ddf7f41d4ed1b33a9ffe3d5939d51f6,"Also considering that our Scope 3 emissions mostly refer to the processing and use of our products, it is important to develop studies that consider such emissions to support future business assessments. During 2022, we developed a methodology that allows the comparison between different projects in terms of economic return and expected Scope 3 emissions. "
"Brazil_Petrobras, 2022, Sustainability Report 2022",[k],116,03a09a0bab3c9afbf02e7ef90381fd0d,"Another assessment that we carry out considers the impact of the development of new products on the emissions intensity of the projected value chain for the company, allowing us to compare different strategies that can support the reduction of emissions associated with our activities. We intend to refine these studies and support ongoing portfolio diversification reviews by incorporating the value chain emissions aspect into the analysis of new diversification initiatives. "
"Brazil_Petrobras, 2022, Sustainability Report 2022","[l, n]",117,2ca4dfa41875a3ce7f886ad58f5c4fc0,"High quality carbon credits as a complementary strategy  We believe that offsetting emissions can be used as a complementary tool in our decarbonization path. These offsets can be natural, taking advantage of the removal potential involved in restoring and preserving forests, soils, oceans and seaweed, or through technological solutions such as carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) and direct CO2 capture from the air (DAC). Although our strategy foresees the use of offsets, these initiatives should be thought of as additional contributions to intrinsic mitigation efforts and do not replace societys need to supply energy with lower carbon intensity.
