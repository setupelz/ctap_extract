"Switzerland_Glencore, 2023, Annual Report",[b],173,c78134e52fb050f5fec7f4c0f7e4dfcf,"With respect to the illustrative climate related sensitivities provided in note 1, we observed that the sensitivities reflected the combined effect of adopting the IEAs long-term price assumptions based on the various IEA climate scenarios, together with the effect of adopting December 2023 spot prices as a starting point for short term price assumptions. The short-term price assumptions in these sensitivities do not reflect the benefit of the short-term pricing environment at the balance sheet date which is significantly higher than the price assumptions referenced in the IEAs report. Accordingly we are satisfied that the sensitivities do not contradict the directors assessment that an impairment is not reasonably possible within the next financial year. "

The decarbonisation transition could result in increasing or decreasing demand for the Groups various commodities, due to policy, regulatory (including carbon pricing mechanisms), legal, technological, market or societal responses to climate change.

"Switzerland_Glencore, 2023, Annual Report",[b],188,a4e331c1a4d373d823aa8723ddbf2ef6,"We use carbon price scenarios to assess the potential impacts on commodity-specific operating cost curves and related supply  demand outcomes, arising from existing and future potential carbon pricing regulation. A key component of this analysis is to understand the potential development of a range of underlying cost curve structures over time and to consider, identify and make reasonable judgements, on the extent to which costs are likely to be passed onto the end consumer. Our analysis shows that under the IEAs NZE2050 scenario, marginal supply costs would increase by at least 10 to potentially over 60, for the range of our most relevant and material commodities. We expect the rising cost of carbon will increase operating costs, increasing the cost of production, which, in turn, would ordinarily be passed on to consumers. In fact, first and second quartile (below average) emission intensity producers, where we see the weighted average of our portfolio residing, are likely to see margin expansion. "

For the purpose of our climate change sensitivities below, we have assumed linear progression of prices between these points, except that since the 2022 baseline reflects particularly high energy prices, which is no longer the case in 2023, we substituted spot December 2023 pricing for calendar 2024, as shown, with linear progression thereafter to the IEAs 2030 price point.
