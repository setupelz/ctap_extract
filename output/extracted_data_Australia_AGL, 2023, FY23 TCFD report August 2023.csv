Following the closure of our coal-fired power stations, AGL will be net zero for operated Scope 1 and 2 emissions.2 In addition to our commitments to accelerate our exit from coal-fired generation, we are seeking to supply our customer demand with 12 GW of additional renewable and firming capacity before 2036, with an interim target of 5 GW by 2030.

This results in approximately 250 GW of renewable and storage capacity being added to the grid over the FY24-FY50 period. Annual emissions levels and emissions intensity of NEM generation declines more rapidly than under Scenarios I and II, owing to earlier coal exits and strong growth in renewable generation, and the NEM reaches net zero emissions in the early 2040s.

This results in approximately 295 GW of additional renewable and storage capacity being required by the grid over the FY24-FY50 period.

This will require substantial investment in new variable generation, transmission, low-emissions dispatchable plants, storage, and technologies that provide system services. Our modelling indicates that while this transition is achievable, the scale of investment required to meet modelled timeframes will present some challenges. AGL is seeking to meet these challenges through our extensive focus on building our development pipeline of renewable and firming generation as well as our battery storage projects. "

Our scenario analysis suggests that coal-fired plants within the NEM would need to retire by no later than FY31 (Scenario IV). Meeting this decarbonisation pathway would require approximately 100 GW of additional capacity by 2030, with capacity needs and associated costs rising to approximately 270 GW and over 180 billion, respectively, by 20501.
