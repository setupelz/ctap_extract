We do not undertake climate modelling ourselves, but we are consistent with the estimates for temperature and cumulative temperature between 2020 to  2050 in the SSPs. The emissions pathway of Aspirational Leadership is most closely aligned with the IPCCs shared socio-economic pathway 1 (SSP1-1.9) with emissions reaching net zero by 2050, which limits warming to 1.5C. Competitive Leadership is most closely aligned with SSP1-2.6 (approximately 2C of warming) and Fragmented Leadership is aligned with emission scenarios SSP2-4.5 (temperatures exceeding 2.5C by 2100). We also use the IPCCs highest emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5) when assessing the physical risks of climate change. So, when assessing risks and opportunities to the business we use a 1.5C-aligned scenario to assess a fast low-carbon transition and we use the highest emissions and high temperature outcome scenario (SSP5-8.5) to assess physical climate risks. While there are many uncertainties about how a changing climate may negatively affect gross domestic product (GDP) growth, physical impacts of climate change are integrated into the GDP growth assumptions in our three scenarios. These are most significant in Fragmented Leadership and least significant in Aspirational Leadership.

Consequently, neither of our two core scenarios are consistent with the expectation of climate policies required to accelerate the global transition to meet the stretch goal of the Paris Agreement.

The business environment is defined by weak final demand and greater uncertainty, and requires close ties with governments to manage risk.

Nations eventually achieve their 2030 Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) as agreed in Paris in 2015 but abandon further progress toward long-term carbon goals as outlined at COP26 in Glasgow.

We are committed to continue to align our climate change disclosures with both of these frameworks. We are also engaging with CA100 as it develops its Net Zero Standard for evaluating action on climate change by diversified mining companies. 
"Australia_Rio Tinto, 2022, Climate Report 2022","[a, e]",36,e292737664148e8218aaabd0fcd95a46,"The CA100 calls on companies to reduce emissions by 45 relative to 2010 levels by 2030, which aligns with the emissions pathway described in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report on 1.5C. Our target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50 compared with 2018 levels by 2030 exceeds this objective. "
"Australia_Rio Tinto, 2022, Climate Report 2022",[e],36,97083674eb1ee83b3a40bea62c02b19a,"At the UN Climate Summit in late 2022 (COP27), there was broad recognition that the pace of decarbonisation across the global economy is too slow to limit warming to 1.5C and that current climate policies in many countries are not yet aligned with their stated ambitions. Consequently, neither of our two core scenarios are consistent with the expectation of climate policies required to accelerate the global transition to meet the stretch goal of the Paris Agreement. Although our operational emissions reduction targets align with the goals of the Paris Agreement, our two core scenarios do not. Consequently, we also assess our sensitivity and test the economic performance of our business against a scenario we have developed (Aspirational Leadership) to reflect our view of the global actions required to meet the stretch goal of the Paris Agreement. Importantly none of our three scenarios are considered a definitive representation for our assessment of the future impact of climate change on the Group.  Scenario modelling has inherent limitations and by its nature allows a range of possible outcomes to be considered where it is impossible to predict which outcome is likely. "
"Australia_Rio Tinto, 2022, Climate Report 2022",[e],37,fcb4fb90d02237e4a84b6231a6b4670b,"The forecast commodity prices (including carbon prices) informed by a blend of our two core scenarios are used pervasively in our financial processes from budgeting, forecasting, capital allocation and project evaluation to the determination of ore reserves. In turn, these prices are used to derive critical accounting estimates included as inputs to impairment testing, estimation of remaining economic life for units of production, depreciation and discounting, closure and rehabilitation provisions. These prices represent our best estimate of actual market outcomes based on the range of future economic conditions regarding matters largely outside our control, as required by the International Financial Reporting Standards. As neither of our core scenarios represents the Groups view of the goals of the Paris Agreement, our commodity price assumptions used in accounting estimates are not consistent with the expectation of climate policies required to accelerate the global transition to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. As described above, we use our Aspirational Leadership scenario to understand the sensitivity of these estimates to Paris-aligned assumptions. The Aspirational Leadership scenario is a commodity sales price and carbon tax sensitivity, with all other inputs remaining equal compared to the two core scenarios and is built by design to reach net-zero emissions globally by 2050 and help us better understand the pathways to meet the Paris Agreement goal, and what this could mean for our business. It is used for strategy and risk discussions, including analysis of sensitivity to our view of a Paris-aligned pathway and comparison of relative economic performance to our core scenarios. "
"Australia_Rio Tinto, 2022, Climate Report 2022",[e],37,6ac571772c69fe0a78e6cf74394df887,"Through our strategy process we compare the economic performance of our portfolio under our two core scenarios and the Aspirational Leadership scenario and this indicates  that overall the economic performance of our portfolio would be stronger in scenarios with proactive climate action, particularly in relation to aluminium, copper and higher-grade iron ore. It is possible therefore, under the right conditions, that historical impairments associated with these assets could reverse. We recognised an impairment of US202 million during the year for the Boyne smelter cash-generating unit, triggered by economic and operating performance of the smelter (refer to Note 4). When measuring the recoverable amount for this cash-generating unit we used net present value of cash flows to the end of the existing joint venture agreements in 2029, which also coincides with the Groups targeted carbon emission reductions by 2030. The Group continues to evaluate lower emission power solutions for the smelter that could extend its life to at least 2040. In such circumstances, the net present value of forecast future cash flows may support the reversal of past impairments. Both the recorded outcome and the sensitivity represent a reduction in emissions that we consider to be Paris-aligned. "
"Australia_Rio Tinto, 2022, Climate Report 2022",[e],37,adb7596abec7b5b38d7144a80ae5bd43,"We anticipate the economic performance associated with our assets that produce lower-grade iron ore to be lower under forward pricing curves consistent with the Paris Agreement. In the Aspirational Leadership scenario we expect the prices for lower-grade iron ore to be supported in the medium term by an assumed increase in GDP-driven demand. However, in the longer term we expect pricing for lower-grade iron ore to be weaker. This will depend on the development of low-emissions steel technology, the pace of which is uncertain. We expect this to be offset by higher prices for higher-grade iron ore. This is highly unlikely to give rise to impairment triggers today or in the foreseeable future due to the high returns on capital employed in the Pilbara. "
"Australia_Rio Tinto, 2022, Climate Report 2022",[e],37,58596a2d34e2b3b8ba9df916ee283a6e,"Overall, based on the Aspirational Leadership scenario pricing outcomes, and with all other assumptions remaining consistent with those applied in our 2022 financial statements, we do not currently expect a material adverse impact of the 1.5C Paris-aligned sensitivity on asset carrying values, remaining useful life, or closure and rehabilitation provisions for the Group. It is possible that other factors may arise in the future, which are not known today, that may impact this assessment. "
