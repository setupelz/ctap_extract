Financial institutions may adopt policies that have the effect of reducing the funding provided to the oil and natural gas industry.  Many of the largest U.S. banks have made net zero commitments and have announced that they will be assessing financed emissions across their portfolios and taking steps to quantify and reduce those emissions.  For example, at COP26, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) announced that commitments from over 450 firms across 45 countries had resulted in over 130 trillion in capital committed to net zero goals.  The various sub-alliances of GFANZ generally require participants to set short-term, sector-specific targets to transition their financing, investing andor underwriting activities to net zero emissions by 2050.  These and other developments in the financial sector could lead to some lenders restricting access to capital for or divesting from certain industries or companies, including the oil and natural gas sector, or requiring that borrowers take additional steps to reduce their GHG emissions.  Additionally, financial institutions may be required to adopt policies that have the effect of reducing the funding provided to the oil and natural gas industry.  For example, the Federal Reserve has joined the Network for Greening the Financial System (the NGFS), a consortium of financial regulators focused on addressing climate-related risks in the financial sector and, in November 2021, issued a statement in support of the efforts of the NGFS to identify key issues and potential solutions for the climate-related challenges most relevant to central banks and supervisory authorities.  In January 2023, the Federal Reserve released instructions for a pilot climate scenario analysis being undertaken by six of the U.S.s largest banks, which took place throughout 2023.  While we cannot predict what policies may result from this, a material reduction in the capital available to the oil and natural gas industry could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration, development, production, transportation and processing activities, which could impact our business and operations.

"USA_Antero Resources, 2024, Annual Report",[l],40,07406aa8b5ea96546e40aaf0b749adc1,"Moreover, while we create and publish voluntary disclosures regarding ESG matters from time to time, many of the statements in those voluntary disclosures are based on hypothetical expectations and assumptions that may or may not be representative of current or actual risks or events or forecasts of expected risks or events, including the costs associated therewith.  Mandatory ESG-related disclosure is also emerging as an area where we may be, or may become, subject to required disclosures in certain jurisdictions, depending on our purported nexus to such jurisdictions and any such mandatory disclosures may similarly necessitate the use of hypothetical, projected or estimated data, some of which is not controlled by us and is inherently subject to imprecision.  Disclosures reliant upon such expectations and assumptions are necessarily uncertain and may be prone to error or subject to misinterpretation given the long timelines involved and the lack of an established single approach to identifying, measuring and reporting on many ESG matters.  In addition, we have established a net zero goal by 2025 with respect to our Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 (indirect from the purchase of energy) GHG emissions, and we could face unexpected material costs as a result of our efforts to meet this goal and any future revisions to it.  We continue to evaluate a range of technology and other measures, such as carbon offsets, that could assist with meeting this goal.  Given uncertainties related to the use of emerging technologies, the state of markets for and the availability of verified carbon offsets, we cannot predict whether or not we will be able to timely meet these goals, if at all.  In addition, while we may seek to only purchase carbon offsets verified by reputable third parties, we cannot guarantee that any carbon offsets we purchase will achieve the GHG emission reductions represented, and we could face increased costs to purchase additional carbon offsets to cover any gap or loss, particularly if carbon offset markets face capacity constraints as a result of increased demand.  Moreover, certain stakeholders may object to the use of offsets generally or with respect to specific transactions we engage in as to any carbon reduction benefits we may claim resulting from such offsets.  Furthermore, certain jurisdictions, including California, are instituting new laws that require disclosures related to voluntary carbon offsets and similar constructs.  Disclosures under these regimes are novel and it is uncertain whether any disclosures we may make in connection therewith will satisfy the laws and may lead to uncertain consequences, such as private parties criticizing such projects, whether via litigation or otherwise.  While we may participate in various voluntary frameworks and certification programs to improve the ESG profile of our operations and products, we cannot guarantee that such participation or certification will have the intended results on our or our products ESG profile.  Also, despite any aspirational goals, we may receive pressure from investors, lenders or other groups to adopt more aggressive climate or other ESG-related goals, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to implement such goals because of potential costs or technical or operational obstacles.

"USA_Antero Resources, 2024, Annual Report",[e],54,3dba288027ee00db5aed5030770c35a6,"Internationally, the United Nations-sponsored Paris Agreement requires member states to individually determine and submit non-binding emissions reduction targets every five years after 2020.  President Biden has recommitted the United States to the Paris Agreement and, in April 2021, announced a goal of reducing the United States emissions by 50-52 below 2005 levels by 2030.  In November 2021, the international community gathered again in COP26, during which multiple announcements were made, including a call for parties to eliminate certain oil and natural gas subsidies and pursue further action on non-CO2 GHGs.  These goals were reaffirmed at COP27 in November 2022.  Relatedly, the United States and European Union jointly announced the launch of the Global Methane Pledge, which aims to cut global methane pollution at least 30 by 2030 relative to 2020 levels, including all feasible reductions in the energy sector.  At COP28 in December 2023, the parties signed onto an agreement to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems and increase renewable energy capacity, though no timeline for doing so was set.  While non-binding, the agreements coming out of COP28 could result in increased pressure among financial institutions and various stakeholders to reduce or otherwise impose more stringent limitations on funding for and increase potential opposition to the exploration and production of fossil fuels.  The impacts of these orders, pledges, agreements and any legislation or regulation promulgated to fulfill the United States commitments under the Paris Agreement, COP26, COP28 or other international conventions cannot be predicted at this time.  Concern over the threat of climate change has also resulted in increasing political risks in the United States, including climate-change related pledges made by President Biden and other public office representatives.  On January 27, 2021, President Biden signed an executive order calling for substantial action on climate change, including, among other things, the increased use of zero-emissions vehicles by the federal government, the elimination of subsidies provided to the oil and natural gas industry and increased emphasis on climate-related risks across agencies and economic sectors.  Additionally, in November 2021, the Biden Administration released The Long-Term Strategy of the United States Pathways to Net-Zero Greenhouse Gas Emissions by 2050, which establishes a roadmap to net zero emissions in the United States by 2050 through, among other things, improving energy efficiency decarbonizing energy sources via electricity, hydrogen, and sustainable biofuels and reducing non-CO2 GHG emissions, such as methane and nitrous oxide.  Other actions that could be pursued include more restrictive requirements for the development of pipeline infrastructure or LNG  export facilities, as well as more restrictive GHG emissions limitations for oil and gas facilities.  For example, on January 26, 2024, President Biden announced a temporary pause on pending decisions on new exports of LNG to countries that the United States does not have free trade agreements with, pending Department of Energy review of the underlying analyses for authorization.  The pause is intended to provide time to integrate certain considerations, including potential energy cost increases for consumers and manufacturers and the latest assessment of the impact of GHG emissions, and to ensure adequate guards against health risks are in place.

Financial institutions, including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth, pension and endowment funds, may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investment into non-oil and natural gas related sectors.  Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil-fuel energy companies have also become more attentive to sustainable lending practices, and some of them may elect in future not to provide funding for oil and natural gas companies.  Many of the largest U.S. banks have made net zero commitments and have announced that they will be assessing financed emissions across their portfolios and taking steps quantify and reduce those emissions.

A material reduction in the capital available to the oil and natural gas industry could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration, development, production, transportation and processing activities, which could result in decreased demand for our products or otherwise adversely impact our financial performance.
