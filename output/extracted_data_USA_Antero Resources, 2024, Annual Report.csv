Financial institutions may adopt policies that have the effect of reducing the funding provided to the oil and natural gas industry.  Many of the largest U.S. banks have made net zero commitments and have announced that they will be assessing financed emissions across their portfolios and taking steps to quantify and reduce those emissions.  For example, at COP26, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) announced that commitments from over 450 firms across 45 countries had resulted in over 130 trillion in capital committed to net zero goals.  The various sub-alliances of GFANZ generally require participants to set short-term, sector-specific targets to transition their financing, investing andor underwriting activities to net zero emissions by 2050.  These and other developments in the financial sector could lead to some lenders restricting access to capital for or divesting from certain industries or companies, including the oil and natural gas sector, or requiring that borrowers take additional steps to reduce their GHG emissions.  Additionally, financial institutions may be required to adopt policies that have the effect of reducing the funding provided to the oil and natural gas industry.  For example, the Federal Reserve has joined the Network for Greening the Financial System (the NGFS), a consortium of financial regulators focused on addressing climate-related risks in the financial sector and, in November 2021, issued a statement in support of the efforts of the NGFS to identify key issues and potential solutions for the climate-related challenges most relevant to central banks and supervisory authorities.  In January 2023, the Federal Reserve released instructions for a pilot climate scenario analysis being undertaken by six of the U.S.s largest banks, which took place throughout 2023.  While we cannot predict what policies may result from this, a material reduction in the capital available to the oil and natural gas industry could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration, development, production, transportation and processing activities, which could impact our business and operations.

Mandatory ESG-related disclosure is also emerging as an area where we may be, or may become, subject to required disclosures in certain jurisdictions, depending on our purported nexus to such jurisdictions and any such mandatory disclosures may similarly necessitate the use of hypothetical, projected or estimated data, some of which is not controlled by us and is inherently subject to imprecision.  Disclosures reliant upon such expectations and assumptions are necessarily uncertain and may be prone to error or subject to misinterpretation given the long timelines involved and the lack of an established single approach to identifying, measuring and reporting on many ESG matters.  In addition, we have established a net zero goal by 2025 with respect to our Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 (indirect from the purchase of energy) GHG emissions, and we could face unexpected material costs as a result of our efforts to meet this goal and any future revisions to it.  We continue to evaluate a range of technology and other measures, such as carbon offsets, that could assist with meeting this goal.  Given uncertainties related to the use of emerging technologies, the state of markets for and the availability of verified carbon offsets, we cannot predict whether or not we will be able to timely meet these goals, if at all.  In addition, while we may seek to only purchase carbon offsets verified by reputable third parties, we cannot guarantee that any carbon offsets we purchase will achieve the GHG emission reductions represented, and we could face increased costs to purchase additional carbon offsets to cover any gap or loss, particularly if carbon offset markets face capacity constraints as a result of increased demand.  Moreover, certain stakeholders may object to the use of offsets generally or with respect to specific transactions we engage in as to any carbon reduction benefits we may claim resulting from such offsets.  Furthermore, certain jurisdictions, including California, are instituting new laws that require disclosures related to voluntary carbon offsets and similar constructs.  Disclosures under these regimes are novel and it is uncertain whether any disclosures we may make in connection therewith will satisfy the laws and may lead to uncertain consequences, such as private parties criticizing such projects, whether via litigation or otherwise.  While we may participate in various voluntary frameworks and certification programs to improve the ESG profile of our operations and products, we cannot guarantee that such participation or certification will have the intended results on our or our products ESG profile.  Also, despite any aspirational goals, we may receive pressure from investors, lenders or other groups to adopt more aggressive climate or other ESG-related goals, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to implement such goals because of potential costs or technical or operational obstacles.

Financial institutions, including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth, pension and endowment funds, may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investment into non-oil and natural gas related sectors.  Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil-fuel energy companies have also become more attentive to sustainable lending practices, and some of them may elect in future not to provide funding for oil and natural gas companies.  Many of the largest U.S. banks have made net zero commitments and have announced that they will be assessing financed emissions across their portfolios and taking steps quantify and reduce those emissions.

A material reduction in the capital available to the oil and natural gas industry could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration, development, production, transportation and processing activities, which could result in decreased demand for our products or otherwise adversely impact our financial performance.
