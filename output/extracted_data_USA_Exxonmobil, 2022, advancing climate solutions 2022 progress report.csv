The scenario illustrates the dramatic societal changes and massive levels of investment required  in a very short period of time  to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Although governments are not implementing changes at the level and pace assumed in the IEA NZE scenario, the detailed assumptions contained in the report enable us to further test the resiliency of our businesses and strategy. The IEAs assumptions demonstrate the significant role ExxonMobil can play in the transition and the growth potential for chemicals, low-emission fuels, carbon capture and storage, and hydrogen. ExxonMobil is positioned to successfully compete in these businesses by leveraging its capabilities and repurposing assets. Throughout the modeled period, IEA NZEs assumed carbon price supports attractive investments in key growth areas that drive increases in cash flow. The Companys core capabilities, experience and advantages in scale, integration, technology, project execution and people would remain critical success factors in this assumed transition path. As the energy system evolves, ExxonMobil will continue to test the resiliency of its business strategy to ensure the Company can deliver shareholder value across a wide range of future scenarios. "

Investments in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and biofuels, would increase significantly as carbon pricing provided in the IEA NZE scenario increases. The Company would continue to make accretive investments in its chemicals business as demand for these products grows in the IEA NZE scenario, with many of these products generating lower life-cycle emissions relative to available alternatives.

It is not intended to communicate any material investment information. The statements and analysis in this document represent a good faith effort by the Company to address these requests despite significant unknown variables and, at times, inconsistent market and government policy signals. Energy demand modeling aims to replicate system dynamics of the global energy system, requiring simplifications. The reference to any scenario, including any potential net-zero scenario, does not imply ExxonMobil views any particular scenario as likely to occur. In addition, energy demand scenarios require assumptions on a variety of parameters. As such, the outcome of any given scenario using an energy demand model comes with a high degree of uncertainty. For example, the IEA describes its NZE scenario as extremely challenging, requiring unprecedented innovation, unprecedented international cooperation and sustained support and participation from consumers. Third-party scenarios discussed in this report reflect the modeling assumptions and outputs of their respective authors, not ExxonMobil, and their use or inclusion herein is not an endorsement by ExxonMobil of their underlying assumptions, likelihood or probability. Investment decisions are made on the basis of ExxonMobils separate planning process, but may be secondarily tested for robustness or resiliency against different assumptions, including against various scenarios.
