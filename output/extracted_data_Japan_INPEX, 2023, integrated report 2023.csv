The second is to achieve a reduction of at least 30 in net carbon intensity (compared to 2019) by 2030 in the process of fulfilling the first goal. The third is to cooperate with all relevant stakeholders across the value chain to reduce the Scope 3 emissions from combustion of the oil and gas we sell.

We employ this method because more than 150 countries and regions have already declared net zero targets by 2050, anticipating a growing number of countries to introduce carbon pricing as they bolster policies to tackle climate change. Each year, we update our internal carbon price with reference to the carbon prices in the Stated Policies Scenario (IEA-STEPS) in the WEO. Starting in FY2023, we reflect the IEA WEO carbon price forecast and, if there is a carbon price system in the country in which we operate, reference our quoted price based on factors such as estimates provided by external experts. If there is no carbon price system in the country in which we operate, we reference variable prices linked to the IEA-STEPS EU prices (2030 US120tCO2e 2040 US129tCO2e 2050 US135 tCO2e). "

This is an evaluation of the impact on our portfolio from the oil and carbon prices in the STEPS, Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), and Net Zero Emissions Scenario (NZE). We apply the oil and carbon prices under these three scenarios to the net present value (NPV) calculation for projects, and calculate the percentage of change from the NPV for the base case to assess the impact on our portfolio. We will continue to refine the implementation standards for this method to improve the competitiveness of our business portfolio as we factor in changes in the business environment. "
