We have voluntarily reported our greenhouse gas emissions, including Scope 3 emissions from the use of our products, for nearly two decades. In 2018, Chevron was among the first oil and gas companies to publish a report aligned with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, and we issued a fourth update in October 2021. We helped the American Petroleum Institute develop a voluntary template for oil and gas companies to report core GHG emissions data to enable greater comparability in climate-related reporting. "
"USA_Chevron, 2021, sustainability report 2021",[p],21,15ddd37127985aeaad09f1f9292f9b68,"Chevrons approach to hydrogen envisions the use of green, blue and gray hydrogen. We believe the use of blue and green hydrogen as a fuel source can help reduce the amount of GHG emissions entering the atmosphere. Although gray hydrogen is viewed as not directly supporting decarbonization of the energy sector, we believe that early-use cases of gray hydrogen can provide key opportunities to minimize the risks of technology enable development of supporting infrastructure, including fueling stations and contribute to lessons learned. Chevron holds more than 75 patents in hydrogen from early commercial ventures that are applicable to our future development plans. "

We are investing directly in scalable, nature-based solutions  like soil carbon storage, reforestation and mangrove restoration. In addition, we plan to monetize excess high-quality credits. We expect to be a portfolio supplier of offsets by providing more customers with offset-paired products. In March 2022, we announced an agreement with Restore the Earth Foundation for a reforestation project for up to 8,800 acres of property in St. Charles Parish, Louisiana, U.S. "

"USA_Chevron, 2021, sustainability report 2021",[l],75,f11af6d7d700e58c6e88be53c2e954e8,"Offsets are credits generated from the avoidance or reduction of GHG emissions or the removal of GHGs from the atmosphere that are purchased or developed and then retired by Chevron, excluding RECs. Includes offsets retired in compliance programs. For programs with multiyear compliance periods, offsets are reported in the calendar year they are retired, except for 2017, where offsets were apportioned to the compliance obligation for that year.

For all products that a company produces or refines, the PCI methodology uses the companys equity GHG emissions and corresponding GHG intensity. To estimate the emissions for marketed products that the company does not produce or refine, the PCI methodology uses industry-average segment factors from the International Energy Agencys World Energy Outlook. Hydrocarbon transportation emissions are estimated in the PCI using IEA World Energy Outlook estimates for transportation emissions from oil and gas. Emissions associated with end use of marketed products are based on industry-standard combustion factors and assume all sold energy products are combusted, although this is not the case (e.g., plastics and lubricants). The graphic on is a depiction of the value chain approach for the refined-product value chain. "
