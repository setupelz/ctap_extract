Targets to reduce GHG emissions are considered science-based if they are in line with what the latest climate science says is necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement  to limit global warming to well-below 2C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5C. Using these scenarios, a science-based target for BHP can be developed by applying the same rate of reduction to BHPs emissions as the rate at which the worlds emissions would have to contract in order to meet the relevant goal (known as the absolute contraction method). Based on our analysis, our medium-term target of at least 30 per cent reduction by FY2030 against FY2020 levels (18) falls within the range of emissions reductions required in this timeframe to be considered aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement.

The project identified and quantified potential operational decarbonisation pathways, and has provided essential data to inform decision-making and prioritisation of BHPs investments in operational decarbonisation initiatives. We will prioritise emissions reductions at our operated assets over the use of offsets, particularly in the early part of this decade, however we expect that offsets may be required to reduce our hard-to-abate emissions, for example fugitive emissions from coal mining and petroleum production.

We have included the lower-end number in the estimate of our Scope 3 emissions, in part to reflect the different ways of calculating Scope 3 emissions, particularly when there is an overlap. The inclusion of two numbers also reflects the different uses for reported Scope 3 emissions. The first, larger number is suitable as a proxy for an assessment of carbon risk to the portfolio.

This metric would be designed to help decision-makers evaluate the trade-off between reducing emissions internally and offsetting externally.
