"USA_Antero Resources, 2022, ESG report",[d],40,c3dbfb246bfecb78b59f4cb38cbe1e73,Risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy  Risks related to the physical impacts of climate change  Antero partnered with a global consulting firm to conduct both a physical and transitional risk assessment in 2021. Information regarding our efforts to assess our risks in alignment with the TCFD framework are below. 
"USA_Antero Resources, 2022, ESG report",[b],40,84b67ebb4527fff1e3085e6837217faf,"In assessing the risks posed by the transition to a low-carbon economy, Antero performed a scenario analysis using two publicly available transition scenarios developed by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) and the Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS). "
"USA_Antero Resources, 2022, ESG report",[b],40,88937887736f3987c258f57e8daa5df7,"These two scenarios are the most widely used and recognized by organizations conducting transition risk assessments however, we recognize the potential for additional scenarios in the future, including the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) and the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE). "

As such, Antero has noted potential benefits associated with pursuing those possible opportunities if and to the extent they are fully realized. "
