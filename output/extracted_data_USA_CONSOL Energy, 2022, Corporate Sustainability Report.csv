Consistent with our focus on innovation, we will continually evaluate opportunities to reduce the other, minor sources of Scope 1 emissions such as through electrification of our vehicle fleet over time. We also aim to mitigate Scope 2 emissions, through means such as the purchase of renewable power or the deployment of solar energy on former or underutilized mining property. Alternatively, our U.S. DOE sponsored 21st Century Power Plant (21CPP) project seeks to design an approximately 400 MWe, waste coal and biomass fueled power plant located in the vicinity of the PAMC. Equipped with Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), the plant is being designed to achieve net negative CO2 emissions. If the project advances to full scale, our mining operations could source power from the plant, to abate scope 2 emissions. Finally, our goals could rely on the use of good quality carbon offsets to account for those emissions that cannot be mitigated or avoided. "

In its World Energy Outlook series, the IEA considers three forward-looking scenarios for global energy demand. These include the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), which explores how the energy system would evolve if current policies are retained, the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), which assumes that stated government targets are achieved on time and in full, and the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE), which reverse engineers what steps would be required to cap global warming to 1.5C. The continued use of coal for power generation, metallurgical, and industrial applications is acknowledged under all three scenarios however, there is significant uncertainty regarding the pace of demand decline, as the energy system strives to balance energy security, reliability, and quality of life. "
"USA_CONSOL Energy, 2022, Corporate Sustainability Report",[e],50,fd3fddf1785fc91dc62ebff249b82b2d,"The aggressive NZE scenario acknowledges that deployment of renewable energy alone is not enough to achieve ambitious goals. To reach net zero and to limit global warming to 1.5C, NZE incorporates behavioral changes that would require a shift away from the comfort and benefits of modern life in developed economies. For instance, the NZE scenario includes assumptions such as a moderate use of car air conditioning, limiting air travel to 2019 levels, requiring that all urban car trips are via rideshare, limiting the maximum speed for vehicle travel to 62 mph, and limiting space heating temperatures to 66F13. These expectations are incompatible with a growing economy and improving standard of living, and as a result, we believe are unlikely to be adopted. "
"USA_CONSOL Energy, 2022, Corporate Sustainability Report","[b, l, m, n]",50,0ef3e6a0d9f2be9bca91c0a5981a7f9a,"IEA acknowledges substantial technology and policy gaps in order to achieve ambitious climate goals. These include the need for a rapid acceleration in the deployment of carbon capture, utilization, and storage, along with technologies that remove CO2 from the atmosphere such as Direct Air Capture (DAC) and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). Currently, around 35 CCUS facilities are in operation today, with the collective capacity to capture almost 45 Mt of CO2 each year14. The IEA NZE scenario assumes that this capacity increases to 1.2 Gt per year by 2030, and 6.2 Gt per year by 205015. To achieve this goal, more than ten new CCUS equipped facilities would need to be commissioned each month between now and 2030. Given the limited number of commercial scale CCUS projects currently in the pipeline, we believe this pace of expansion seems infeasible. "
