For a below 2C scenario, the risk of  heat waves remains similar to the current risk, however at above 4C it increases notably in the future. Despite this, it is expected that most buildings and areas placed manufacturing sites are air-conditioned, which mitigates the risk of heat waves to cause business interruptions or reduced efficiency. Climate models indicate that the flood risk will remain rather constant in the future across all climate scenarios, and only five of 62 locations will likely experience a decisive increase in flood risk. Extreme precipitation could become enhanced for about half of Holcims locations, especially if global temperatures rise above 4C compared to the pre-industrial era. "
"Switzerland_Holcim, 2022, climate report 2022",[f],88,45cc1ab924ea2d9dc683c694311f51ae,"The disruption of supply chains by climate extremes can pose a significant threat to Holcims business operations. An example of this is the Mississippi River, which acts as an important waterway for Holcim to efficiently and affordably transport products to distributors and construction sites. The river basin has a long history of droughts and floods that affected economic activities along the Mississippi River (e.g. flooding in April 2011 and the drought in 2021). High and low water levels can impede planned transportation schedules causing delays. This results in business interruptions and additional costs. The vulnerability of the Mississippi transport system to climate extremes is amplified by an aging infrastructure and climate change. An increasing trend of spring time high water level extremes has already been observed over the past two decades compared to pre-1990  water levels. Based on a likely increase in precipitation extremes with a changing climate, high water levels are expected to occur more frequently in both a 2C and 4C scenario by 2050. Low water level extremes will likely occur more frequently in 2C scenarios but decrease in a 4C world. Hence, in the near term, the drought-flood variability will be a considerable challenge, while in the long-term, high water levels will dominate the supply chain risk. "
