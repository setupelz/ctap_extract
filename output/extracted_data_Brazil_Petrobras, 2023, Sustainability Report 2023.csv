These paths involve the implementation of all available energy sources and technological solutions, including oil and gas, renewable fuels, and negative emissions technologies. "
"Brazil_Petrobras, 2023, Sustainability Report 2023",[e],93,22ead032a28203807294838f3694a4f4,"Our positioning, actions and results related to carbon management and climate change are supported by three fundamental pillars  TRANSPARENCY, CARBON MANAGEMENT, AND A FAIR TRANSITION  Our climate change and energy transition risk management governance is structured in such a way that all levels of the company, including senior management, are involved in the topic. We work to ensure that carbon risks and opportunities are adequately captured in scenarios, quantified, and considered in our choices and decision-making processes, seeking the sustainability of our business, and generating value for all interested parties. The variable remuneration of all employees incorporates performance elements linked to carbon intensity commitments in our operations, engaging the workforce in achieving expected results.TRUST IN INFORMATION, PROCESSES, AND DECISIONS  In our understanding, companies will become more competitive in the long-term market the more they are able to produce at low costs and with lower greenhouse gas emissions, thriving in scenarios of low oil prices, carbon pricing and possible practices of oil dierentiation  based on the intensity of carbon emissions in its production. We seek to keep our operations with a decreasing emissions trajectory and with a lower carbon intensity than the main companies in the industry, safeguarding the competitiveness of our oils in global markets in a scenario of slowdown and subsequent retraction in demand. We focus on supplying oil and gas in a competitive and environmentally responsible manner, aiming to meet the persistent demand for oil in line with scenarios compatible with the goals of the Paris Agreement.RESILIENCE AND VALUE OF THE FOSSIL PORTFOLIO IN THE FACE OF TRANSITION  We recognize that the goals of the Paris Agreement require deep  reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and the transformation of energy supply. Our scenarios point to an unequivocal energy transition, albeit at an uncertain pace. "

For other emissions, , we aim to achieve neutrality within a period compatible with the Paris Agreement, in line with local commitments and international organizations. "
"Brazil_Petrobras, 2023, Sustainability Report 2023","[l, o]",108,f3acb614781a15b05efa28e479e29f39,"We believe that emissions offsets from carbon credits can be used as a complementary tool in our decarbonization trajectory.  These credits can be nature-based, taking advantage of the potential of forests, soils, oceans, and seaweed, or obtained through technological solutions. While we expect offset use, these initiatives should be thought of as additional contributions to intrinsic mitigation efforts and do not replace the societys need to supply less carbon-intensive energy.
