They agreed to keep global temperature rises below 2 degrees Celsius (°C) above pre-industrial levels, and to work toward a 1.5°C limit. Greenhouse gases (GHGs) Gases that trap heat into the atmosphere, therefore contributing to the warming of the planet. They are often expressed as CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) in terms of their GHG impact levels over time using CO2 as a reference. Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) Carbon dioxide equivalent is a simple way of comparing the warming potential of a range of GHGs (including carbon dioxide and methane) by converting their amounts to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide. Carbon neutral at the product level (based on ISO 14021, 2016) All the GHG (or CO2e) emissions from all stages of the product life cycle, and within the specified processes, have been reduced, removed or, as a last resort, accounted for through a system of offsets resulting in a product that has a carbon footprint of zero. Net zero at the corporate level (based on the Science Based Targets initiative) Net zero emissions are achieved when anthropogenic emissions of GHGs to the atmosphere are balanced by anthropogenic removals over a specified period.
