"USA_ExxonMobil, 2023, Global Outlook executive summary","[a, f]",2,2f5e052a307e68826d0557e883fc75bb,"As lower-emission options grow, we project the worlds energy-related CO2 emissions will decline 25 by 2050. Thats a major change as these emissions rose by 10 over the past decade. While the progress is substantial, larger reductions are needed to keep global warming from exceeding 2 Celsius, according to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). "
"USA_ExxonMobil, 2023, Global Outlook executive summary",[b],3,7f8b65676b42e72ac9adecacb185905a,"Unlike the companys Outlook, which is a projection, many scenarios, such as International Energy Agencys Net Zero Emissions (IEA NZE) by 2050, work backward from a hypothetical outcome to identify the factors needed to achieve that outcome. It is important to note that the IEA acknowledges that society is not on a net-zero pathway, and that the NZE scenario assumes unprecedented energy efficiency gains, innovation and technology transfer, lower-emission investments, and globally coordinated greenhouse-gas reduction policy by governments.

CO2 emissions are captured, transported by pipeline to suitable geologic formations, and permanently stored deep underground. Carbon capture can also serve as a negative emissions technology that removes CO2 from the atmosphere   a critical solution in many IPCC Likely Below 2C scenarios and one that has been endorsed by the European Union, U.S. administration, and the United Nations.

Currently, only two of the 55 technologies needed to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 are on track, according to the International Energy Agency.

Separate from ExxonMobils analysis, we discuss a number of third-party scenarios such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Likely Below 2C and the International Energy Agency Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenarios. Third-party scenarios discussed in this report reflect the modeling assumptions and outputs of their respective authors, not ExxonMobil, and their use and inclusion herein is not an endorsement by ExxonMobil of their results, likelihood or probability. Work on the Outlook and report was conducted during 2022 and early 2023. The report contains forward looking statements, including projections, targets, expectations, estimates and assumptions of future behaviors. Actual future conditions and results (including energy demand, energy supply, the growth of energy demand and supply, the impact of new technologies, the relative mix of energy across sources, economic sectors and geographic regions, imports and exports of energy, emissions and plans to reduce emissions) could differ materially due to changes in economic conditions, the ability to scale new technologies on a cost-effective basis, unexpected technological developments, the development of new supply sources, changes in law or government policy, political events, demographic changes and migration patterns, trade patterns, the development and enforcement of global, regional or national mandates, changes in consumer preferences, and other factors discussed herein and under the heading Factors Affecting Future Results in the Investors section of our website at .
