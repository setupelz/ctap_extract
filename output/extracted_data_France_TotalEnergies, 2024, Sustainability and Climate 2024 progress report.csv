Similarly, the native CO2 separated in the new NFE and NFS LNG liquefaction trains currently under development will be stored by QatarEnergy. The same will be true for the native CO2 separated on Cameron LNG to be stored in the Hackberry CCS storage facility in the context of a new train project by Cameron LNG. Finally, for our Ichthys LNG asset in Australia, we are studying a native CO2 storage solution for start-up before 2030.
