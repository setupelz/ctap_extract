The entities in which TotalEnergies SE directly or indirectly owns a shareholding are separate legal entities. This document makes reference to greenhouse gas emissions. The Company has control over emissions from the facilities it operates (Scope 1) and their indirect emissions from purchased energy (Scope 2). By contrast, it does not have control over emissions from the end use of its products by its customers (Scope 3), and trends in those emissions depend largely on external factors, such as government policies and customer choices (for additional information on the definition of Scope 1, 2 and 3, refer to the Universal Registration Document).
