"UK_Rio Tinto, 2023, Climate Report 2023","[e, k]",3,b5803b61a937bc4202da15c420c359c1,"Many 1.5C scenarios now overshoot the long-term temperature goal and rely on significant deployment of carbon dioxide removals to get to net zero that may not be plausible. No single company or country can halt the course of climate change alone, so partnering to reduce emissions is vital. This is why we put the low-carbon transition at the heart of our business strategy and are working with governments, customers, communities and others to decarbonise our operations and value chains. "
"UK_Rio Tinto, 2023, Climate Report 2023",[e],3,2962e1b209adb9444ec1f85ca7d18e6d,"Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions targets are a 15 reduction by 2025 and 50 by 2030 relative to 2018 levels. These targets are ambitious and aligned with 1.5C, the stretch goal of the Paris Agreement. They are particularly ambitious as, unlike our competitors, around 80 of our emissions come from processing activities, which are typically hard to abate. "
"UK_Rio Tinto, 2023, Climate Report 2023",[e],9,4bf83b050f83014781eeeabf031a04b0,Capital allocation alignment with our 1.5C decarbonisation strategy  We estimate the total capital expenditure on decarbonisation between 2022 and 2030 is expected to be 5-6 billion1 and 1.5 billion in the period 2024-2026. 
"UK_Rio Tinto, 2023, Climate Report 2023","[e, k]",10,ed35e1dfa9be204ea2d37164937b05b8,"While there is no universal standard for determining the alignment of targets with the Paris Agreement goals, we conclude our Scope 1 and 2 targets for 2030 are aligned with efforts to limit warming to 1.5C. In 2021, KPMG provided limited assurance over the alignment of our Scope 1 and 2 targets with efforts to limit warming to 1.5C. For this 2023 report, KPMG provide limited assurance over our progress reporting against our Climate Action Plan commitments (in addition to their assurance of our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions). Their statement is included at the end of the report. "
"UK_Rio Tinto, 2023, Climate Report 2023",[l],26,a623fcc4d8e31a5d6885afd9a34f0f31,We expect to ramp-up the retirement of carbon credits to approximately 3.5 million per year over the next decade. This is equivalent to around 10 of our 2018 baseline emissions. We will then flex this up or down depending on the level of progress we make on technology breakthroughs for our hard-to-abate emissions. 
"UK_Rio Tinto, 2023, Climate Report 2023",[k],29,d99422907ae933addcc188b93fb67fa4,"Illustrative Scope 3 emissions trajectories (Mt CO2e)  Estimates are based on current product and customer mix. The net zero trajectory for our Scope 3 emissions and the illustrative Scope 3 trajectory represent two potential pathways, and are not definitive forecasts. "
"UK_Rio Tinto, 2023, Climate Report 2023",[e],34,7cd83acfdae6bbdead933440dcb9180d,"Pricing of future carbon penalties remains uncertain, but based on todays policies we expect a long-term return across our portfolio of 3 to 5. While this is currently below our cost of capital, when modelled under our Competitive Leadership scenario which limits the global temperature outcome to 1.8C, we see returns increasing to 10 to 13, indicating that the business of decarbonisation is good business.
