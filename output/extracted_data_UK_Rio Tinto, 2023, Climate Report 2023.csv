"UK_Rio Tinto, 2023, Climate Report 2023",[e],3,16641860c25a7b721e4daf9055e2411e,"2023 was another year of extreme weather and broken temperature records. In December, I attended the UN climate summit (COP28) and came away concerned the world is not on track with the Paris Agreement goal to limit warming to 1.5C by 2100. National targets are not in line with the overall goal, and current climate policies in many countries are not yet aligned with their stated ambitions. "
"UK_Rio Tinto, 2023, Climate Report 2023","[e, k]",3,b5803b61a937bc4202da15c420c359c1,"Many 1.5C scenarios now overshoot the long-term temperature goal and rely on significant deployment of carbon dioxide removals to get to net zero that may not be plausible. No single company or country can halt the course of climate change alone, so partnering to reduce emissions is vital. This is why we put the low-carbon transition at the heart of our business strategy and are working with governments, customers, communities and others to decarbonise our operations and value chains. "
"UK_Rio Tinto, 2023, Climate Report 2023",[e],3,2962e1b209adb9444ec1f85ca7d18e6d,"Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions targets are a 15 reduction by 2025 and 50 by 2030 relative to 2018 levels. These targets are ambitious and aligned with 1.5C, the stretch goal of the Paris Agreement. They are particularly ambitious as, unlike our competitors, around 80 of our emissions come from processing activities, which are typically hard to abate. "
"UK_Rio Tinto, 2023, Climate Report 2023",[k],3,574d37ff9bb7961e240f5619b55f039c,"Our Scope 3 emissions were 578Mt CO2e in 2023, of which 94 come from our customers processing our products. When we engage with our customers and their governments on climate change, we see they have real commitments to reduce their emissions. However, as they stand today, we estimate that those emissions will reach net zero by around 2060. It is clear that our customers and suppliers see Rio Tinto as being able to help them make a real difference to decarbonise. But it is clear we must do more, so we are committing to help them find better ways to achieve their targets a decade earlier  reaching net zero by 2050. "

In 2021, KPMG provided limited assurance over the alignment of our Scope 1 and 2 targets with efforts to limit warming to 1.5C. For this 2023 report, KPMG provide limited assurance over our progress reporting against our Climate Action Plan commitments (in addition to their assurance of our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions). Their statement is included at the end of the report. "
"UK_Rio Tinto, 2023, Climate Report 2023",[l],26,a623fcc4d8e31a5d6885afd9a34f0f31,We expect to ramp-up the retirement of carbon credits to approximately 3.5 million per year over the next decade. This is equivalent to around 10 of our 2018 baseline emissions. We will then flex this up or down depending on the level of progress we make on technology breakthroughs for our hard-to-abate emissions.

While this is currently below our cost of capital, when modelled under our Competitive Leadership scenario which limits the global temperature outcome to 1.8C, we see returns increasing to 10 to 13, indicating that the business of decarbonisation is good business.
