"France_Atos, 2021, Tackling climate change","[e, d]",1,c99d09e11fff4f00d8f3b6fb4a3ef9ef,"Atos has now committed to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2039 at latest, a date which is 11 years ahead of the ambitious aim of the UN Paris Agreement on Climate Change to limit the global warming of the planet to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels (net-zero by 2050). This decision expands our ambitions on decarbonization even further, positioning decarbonization as a core element of our growth strategy and as the decarbonization leader in our industry. With the targets aligned with the newest standards shared by Science-Based Target initiative, we confirm our commitment towards the fight against climate change. "
"France_Atos, 2021, Tackling climate change",[e],1,70b62e471f958c64a68d3ebed21cfef7,"Head of Group Corporate Social Responsibility, Atos  Our decision to achieve net-zero emissions by 2039 at the latest marks a new step forward. It shows our strong commitment with the fight against climate change. We believe that working together with our stakeholders, we can accelerate the reduction of GHG emissions in the whole value chain. This is what we urgently need to limit the increase of temperature to 1.5C as by the Paris Agreement. "

"France_Atos, 2021, Tackling climate change","[e, d]",2,030dc3b34e8bad3c753f7bef019ecba7,"The Program is embedded across the activities of the organization, including RD and procurement. To support the global fight against climate change, Atos has further reduced the energy consumption and carbon footprint of its digital solutions and technologies (eco-efficient digital technologies). This includes green IT best practices, life cycle assessments, eco-design, eco-label guidelines, dedicated RD investments on energy and carbon, selection of low-energy subcomponents and adoption of the Circular Economy principles. Working with suppliers to decarbonize the value chain is also an objective of the Group. Emission reduction activities within or linked to Atoss supply chain include  Ongoing work with existing suppliers and negotiation of specific progress plans  New supplier selection criteria include an increased weight of CSR risk and environmental topics and objectives (including well-below 2C and 1.5C Science-Based Targets)  A reinforcement of the energy consumption and CO2e emissions as key purchasing criteria for goods and services  The inclusion of the cost of energy and of the internal carbon price into business cases and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculations.
