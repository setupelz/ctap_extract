However, our analysis suggests that demand for seaborne steelmaking coal will remain robust through 2050 across these scenarios, in large part due to steel demand growth in regions that rely on low-cost, high-quality seaborne steelmaking coaland specifically hard coking coalimports.

British Columbia has been a world leader in imposing carbon taxation, and we are subject to carbon taxes that are not borne by our major competitors.
