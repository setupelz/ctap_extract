"South Africa_exxaro, 2020, climate change position statement",[e],4,7e49a557ab6e9587220761b1fa549454,The Paris Agreement has a long-term goal of achieving net-zero emissions by the second half of this century. It outlines an obligation known as the Global Stocktake for parties to the Agreement to assess progress toward the purpose and goals of the Agreement every five years. The Global Stocktake will shape the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that countries submit as part of their efforts to support the net-zero emissions target.

For 2030, this number is approximately US50  tCO2e and US100tCO2e in 2040. The South African first phase (2020 2023) of the carbon tax is at US8tCO2e and sentiment is that this will increase in subsequent phases to between US12  50tCO2e. The increase in the carbon tax will increase operational costs and the expectation is that suppliers will pass through their carbon tax liabilities downstream. "

Areas  immediately west will be warmer by more than 6C, and in some places 8C.
