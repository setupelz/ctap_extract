"Saudi Arabia_Saudi Aramco, 2023, climate change and the energy transition",[l],12,928f80bb5bf3c3a6dd537e385f171fea,"Aramco retired approximately 500,000 carbon credits in 2023, against a corporate emissions plan to use carbon markets to support the delivery of our 2035 and 2050 emissions mitigation ambition, while directing climate finance towards climate change mitigation solutions. The use of carbon offsets is an important part of  Aramcos net-zero planning as they enable mitigation of hard-to-abate emissions and allow us to accelerate emissions reduction action, particularly where alternatives, such as CCS, are not fully mature and scalable.

"Saudi Arabia_Saudi Aramco, 2023, climate change and the energy transition",[n],13,b01a574c9844367b3ab886f8cddb012a,"In addition to developing technologies to capture carbon dioxide at the point of emissions, we are also researching and testing solutions to reduce the cost of capturing carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere, via Direct Air Capture (DAC). Aramco is collaborating with Siemens Energy to develop a DAC test unit in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. The test unit, which is expected to be completed in 2024, is intended to pave the way for a larger pilot plant. Captured carbon dioxide can be utilized as part of a circular carbon economy. "
