The first one is to replace fossil fuels with hydrogen as an alternative fuel. Hydrogen will not only help to decarbonize our emissions from transportation activities but also those  from our kilns. While our main focus will continue to be waste-derived fuels, we will explore using green hydrogen as a booster where applicable. Kiln electrification is also being investigated to replace the use of traditional fuels. "
