The cement industry is making significant efforts toward net-zero development and innovation, while climate change mitigation and adaptation have a growing importance. Carbon capture, utilization and storage technologies are developing at a pace consistent with the industry’s transition to net-zero. Demand for low-carbon and material-efficient solutions and those that mitigate the impacts of climate change accelerates. Physical impacts of climate change are manageable without significant business or societal disruption. Holcim’s sustainability leadership brings strategic resilience to the company.
