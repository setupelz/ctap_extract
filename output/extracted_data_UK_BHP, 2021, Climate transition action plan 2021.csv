These are principally in the areas of technology development (including cost). Beyond this, there are a range of regional factors that are equally influential (and in some cases maybe more so) in determining likely future pathways. Key factors include  Availability of lower carbon raw material feedstock (including but not exclusively scrap)  Variable levels of policy support (either subsidies for technology or carbon pricing to incentivise abatement)  Exposure to international trade in steel and steel products  65 (<httpswww.iea.orgreportsiron-and-steel-technology-roadmap>)httpswww.iea.orgreportsiron-and-steel-technology-roadmap  66 See, for example, the Global Financial Markets Association,  Different regions will progress decarbonisation at different paces because of the factors outlined above.

It is not like the whole-system modelling with global temperature outcomes like our Central Energy or Lower Carbon scenarios. Deep Green is also entirely separate to BHPs 1.5C scenario (which is a global top-down technical model more similar in approach to the Central Energy and Lower Carbon scenarios) In this Deep Green hypothetical, global steel emissions fall by around two-thirds from current levels, bringing absolute volumes well below the 1990 base level. That is significant, but is not net zero. Even in Europe, which has positive exposure to the factors outlined above, net zero is not achieved. Under the Deep Green hypothetical, primary iron demand could be modestly affected due to higher scrap use. Metallurgical coal demand volumes may be lower than projected in our climate change scenarios due to  higher penetration of alternative steelmaking processes. However, potential reduction in demand could be offset by expected increase in premiums for higher quality coal, which BHP would be well placed to capture. It is important to emphasise that we consider the likelihood of the Deep Green hypothetical to be much lower than our Central and Lower Carbon scenarios. "
"UK_BHP, 2021, Climate transition action plan 2021",[l],16,72c3ead81b2b533a80ebff401da785a5,"We do note that the commitment to enable swifter decarbonisation pathways in the steel sector is gathering momentum. Today, 34 per cent of BHPs current iron sales are to customers that have net zero targets in place. These commitments are underpinned by net zero commitments in the major Asian steelmaking nations of China (2060), Japan (2050) and South Korea (2050). However, although ambitions are growing, a pathway to net zero for steel is still highly uncertain. Despite the supportive regulatory landscape, emitters may still be constrained by bottlenecks in scrap availability and the ramp up of low emissions steelmaking capacity. Notably, some steelmakers expect to utilise offsets and carbon abatement solutions (including CCUS), in addition to new production technologies, to achieve their long-term goals. "
