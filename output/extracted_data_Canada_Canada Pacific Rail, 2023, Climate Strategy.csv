Among other updates, as part of our Commitment to Climate Action, CPKC committed to establishing an emissions reduction target aligned with a 1.5C future. To guide the Companys near-term climate actions, we also established a new 2030 greenhouse gas (GHG emissions reduction target for CPKCs combined locomotive operations using the Science Based Targets initiatives (SBTi sectoral-based approach for freight railroads and a well-below 2C global warming scenario. The combined CPKC target has updated and replaced the GHG emissions reduction targets announced within this Climate Strategy, which were retired in 2023.

It is informed by research, science and an appreciation of where we can make the greatest impact. CP completed a comprehensive, quantitative climate scenario analysis to support our understanding of potential physical impacts to our operations posed by a changing climate, as well as the risks and opportunities associated with the global transition to a low-carbon economy. These insights help us understand how the future may unfold so we can plan accordingly and position CP for success in a low-carbon economy. Building on this  information, our science-based targets provide a clear marker against which we can measure our progress as we work toward longer term and more significant decarbonization. Achieving these ambitions will require a variety of actions to reduce our carbon footprint, and we recognize that further technology advancement, business integration and purposeful engagement with our stakeholders will be required.

CPs analysis integrated a number of factors to represent plausible future pathways based on credible science, developed by experts at the International Energy Agency (IEA) and other reputable organizations. These scenarios reflect combinations of potential policy changes, technological advancements, market shifts and changes in consumer behaviours. For CP, each scenario represents a trajectory under which the climate, economy and rail industry may change during the coming decades. "

These potential risks and opportunities were more generally characterized as impacts in recognition that some may be a risk under one scenario and an opportunity under another. These eight potential impacts are also aligned with the TCFDs categories of policy, technology, market and physical risks.7  New or additional carbon pricing could lead to increased costs to CP, which may impact CPs advantage over competitors.

Under the well-below 2C scenario that CP assessed (IEAs Sustainable Development Scenario), the world embraces climate action and pushes for changes in regulations, markets and technologies to transition to a more decarbonized global system.

Our climate scenario analysis also considered how policy, market, technology and physical impacts may manifest under a more modest degree of change (aligned with IEAs Stated Policies Scenario), where climate action is slow and warming amounts to 3 to 3.5C and a business as usual scenario where no (or limited) action is taken and warming reaches 5 to 6C. Together, the comparison of these scenarios supports our understanding of where risks and opportunities exist and how they may materialize based on broader social, economic and political changes. "
