"Canada_Cenovus Energy, 2023, Annual Report",[b],60,f9bb8c5888841d6418c6edbb22b5d732,"We integrate the potential	 impact	 of	 climate change and	 GHG	 regulations	 and	 the cost	 of	 carbon	 at	 various	 price levels	 into	 our business	 planning	 processes.	 To	 mitigate uncertainty	 surrounding	 future emissions	 regulation, we evaluate our development	 plans	 under a	 range of	 carbon-constrained	 scenarios.	 We have considered	 the International	 Energy	 Agency	 (IEA)	 scenarios	 in	 our strategic	 planning	 for several	 years	 and	 conduct	 ongoing	 assessments	 of	 both	 public	 and	 private scenarios.	 Although	 Management	 believes	 that	 our climate-related	 estimates	 are reasonable, aligned	 with	 current, pending	 and	 potential	 future regulations, and	 informed	 by	 the IEAs	 climate scenarios, they	 are based	 on	 numerous	 assumptions	 that, if	 false, may	 have a	 material	 adverse effect	 on	 our business, financial	 condition	 and	 results	 of	 operations.	 Specifically, climate-related	 estimates	 influence our financial	 planning	 and	 investment	 decisions.	 Since we plan	 and	 evaluate opportunities	 partially	 on	 the basis	 of	 climate-related	 estimates, variations	 between	 actual	 outcomes	 and	 our expectations	 may	 have a	 material	 adverse effect	 on	 our business, 	financial	condition, 	results	of	operations, 	reputation	and	cash	flows.
