However, achieving the net zero ambition by 2050 does not require this scenario to eventuate, as we can pursue a number of pathways. By deliberately not locking ourselves into a single 2050 pathway, we can  optimise costs, avoid large-scale infrastructure lock-in and minimise the likelihood of stranded assets and regret capital. The incremental introduction of certain technologies and feedstocks in the short to medium term offers optionality. Should particular technologies prove to be more cost-effective, we would be in a position to potentially integrate them into our operations. This agile approach is supported by conclusions reached by the IEA in its 2021 Net Zero 2050 report, and others. "

In 2018, we undertook downscaled climate modelling at our main operating sites.

We are now looking into the merits of procuring additional tools to help us advance our modelling work into key performance indicators and quantitative metrics. In this way, we aim to keep abreast of changing climate dynamics, evolving vulnerabilities and exposure patterns to undertake proactive planning. Further work on site-specific adaptation risk profile reviews confirmed that there are no new risks identified for our at-risk sites. While our operations have a good understanding of potential physical climate change risk events, more work is being undertaken to align potential business impact with risk events.

This type of work will help us increase the resilience of our operational sites, see 2023 SR . We have in place systems and tools, including early warning, emergency response and overall preparedness for extreme weather events. These are continuously refined and updated as gaps are identified.

Collaboration and information sharing will be pivotal. As maturity builds across supply chains, we aim to work more closely with our suppliers, service providers and customers to co-create strategies that effectively address risks and achieve the requisite economies of scale. We acknowledge that we cannot accomplish our adaptation goals on our own. Adaptation-specific partnerships will help support our overall adaptation efforts. Similar to when we partnered with the CSIR for our downscaled modelling work (page 21), we intend to partner with other academic institutions, government bodies and industries that have expertise in adaptation.

We acknowledge that our 30 emission reduction target by 2030 is not 1,5C aligned and we utilised different methodologies such as absolute contraction, Climate Action Tracker and incorporated NDC goals in our target setting. For 2050, we set our ambition to achieve net zero emissions which is aligned to a 1,5C World. "
