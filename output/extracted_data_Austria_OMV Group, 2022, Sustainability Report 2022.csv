Physical hazard modeling was applied, consisting of the processing and analysis of atmospheric data related to temperature, precipitation, drought, and wildfires, as well as other data related to coastal flooding, tropical cyclones, water stress, and fluvial flooding, in order to provide a rigorous estimate of risk. The analysis incorporated scenarios based on the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The four RCPs (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) included in the IPCC AR5 were used in this exercise and applied to various time horizons that align with the OMV Strategy. Once the financial impact of the respective risks was estimated, potential mitigation strategies were discussed with management in order to ensure that appropriate adaptation measures were considered.

The base case is used for mid-term planning and estimates that are used in the measurement of various items in the Group financial statements, including impairment testing of non-financial assets and measuring provisions. The stress case is based on a faster decarbonization path than the base case, and is used to calculate sensitivities in order to acknowledge the uncertainty in the pace of the energy transition and to better understand the financial risk of the energy transition to OMVs existing assets. Both scenarios, the base and stress cases, reflect more climate change mitigation efforts and a faster decarbonization path than the scenarios used in the prior year. But OMV still expects to see the energy transition occurring at different speeds in different parts of the world. "

In this scenario, it is assumed that advanced economies will reach the net zero emissions goal by 2050, while middle-income and developing economies will only follow at a later point, but no later than 2070. This case is built on a path between the IEA SDS and IEA NZE scenarios. The entire world following the commitments of the Paris Agreement leads to lower global demand for oil and gas and consequently to lower oil and gas prices than in the base case. In addition, this scenario incorporates other possible effects such as slower short-term economic growth. "

It presents a pathway for the global energy sector to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. For investment decisions, business cases are calculated based on the same price and demand assumptions as those used for the mid-term planning and impairment tests. In addition, a business case calculation based on the stress case assumptions is mandatory for all investment decisions in order to assess the economic viability under a Paris-aligned scenario. The IEA NZE scenario is not used for making investment decisions. "

In addition, some oil and gas assets with unproved reserves would be abandoned with a pre-tax profit  loss impact of EUR 0.3 bn. For EP oil and gas assets, an additional sensitivity based on oil and gas prices according to the IEA NZE scenario was calculated and showed a decrease in the carrying amount of oil and gas assets with proved and unproved reserves (including EP goodwill) of EUR 6.1 bn.

By 2050, OMV aims to transform into a net zero business.6  In 2022, OMV has set out a roadmap with concrete interim short-, medium-, and long-term targets for the first time. OMV targets are set at an absolute and intensity level with the ultimate goal of achieving net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Scopes 1, 2, and 3 by 2050. For Scopes 1 and 2, OMV is aiming for an absolute reduction of 30 by 2030 and of 60 by 2040. For Scope 3, from our product portfolio and other material Scope 3 emissions, OMV is striving for a reduction of at least 20 by 2030 and of 50 by 2040. These absolute GHG emission reductions and the increase of zero-carbon product energy sales are the key to reducing the carbon intensity of our energy supply, pursuing a decline of 20 by 2030 and of 50 by 2040. These targets are approximated to IEAs Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS). However, our ambition is to achieve net zero emissions already by 2050, thus being aligned with the IEAs Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE). "

To concretize our 2050 goals, we have set mid- and long-term targets to reduce our absolute Scope 3 emissions by at least 20 by 2030 and by at least 50 by 2040, both against the baseline year 2019. In addition, we intend to reduce the carbon intensity of our energy supply by at least 20 by 2030 and by at least 50 by 2040, both against the baseline year 2019.

While the biggest drivers on this journey will be decreasing our fossil fuel sales and increasing our zero-carbon product sales, we also recognize that neutralization measures will be necessary. Neutralization measures include, but are not limited to, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU), Bio-energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), as well as, to a very limited extent, voluntary offsetting (technological and nature-based solutions). By 2030, we aim to establish CCS capacities of around 5 mn t per year as our main neutralization measure toward achieving our targets. We will minimize the use of carbon credits for voluntary offsets as a contributor toward achieving our GHG reduction target. This is to ensure that we are not simply buying our way out of our responsibility to act on climate change and the energy transition. "

Carbon capture and utilization technologies, such as capturing CO2 emissions from our refineries, hydrating the CO2, and then reusing it as fuel, are crucial to reducing overall atmospheric emissions and fostering circularity. However, achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement does not just require reducing our own emissions but also helping reduce atmospheric emissions from other sources. Thus, our CCS and CCU projects include, but are not limited to, capturing our own emissions. A key example of developing such projects with industry partners to reduce overall atmospheric emissions is the C2PAT project. "
