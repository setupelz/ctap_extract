Physical hazard modeling is applied, consisting of the processing and analysis of atmospheric data related to temperature, precipitation, drought, and wildes, as well as other data related to coastal flooding, tropical cyclones, water stress, and fluvial flooding, in order to provide a rigorous estimate of risk. The analysis incorporates scenarios based on the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The four RCPs (2.6, 4.5,  6.0, and 8.5) included in the IPCC AR5 are used in this exercise and applied to various time horizons that align with the OMV Strategy. Once the ancial impact of the respective risks is estimated, potential mitigation strategies are discussed with management in order to ensure that appropriate adaptation measures are considered. "

"Austria_OMV Group, 2023, Sustainability Report 2023",[b],44,87a4ce57b8723d0eece169a0dee57a99,"The base case is built on a scenario developed by the internal Market Intelligence department and assumes that all decarbonization pledges announced by governments around the world will be implemented in full and on time. In this scenario, the temperature increase by 2100 will be limited to 1.7C with a probability of 50. The underlying demand and price developments of fossil commodities are in line with the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), which  was modeled by the International Energy Agency (IEA). The base case is used for mid-term planning as well as for estimates relating to the measurement of various items in the Group ancial statements, including impairment testing of non-ancial assets and the measurement of provisions.

The assumptions used in this case are in line with the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) scenario modeled by the IEA. It shows a pathway for the global energy sector to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 and is compatible with limiting the temperature increase to 1.5C. "

Crude oil distillation throughput will be decreased. The product mix will be adapted to reduce heating oil and diesel output while increasing the chemical yield. In parallel, a production portfolio of renewable fuels and sustainable chemical feed-stocks will be developed. Taking into account these transformation plans, management does not foresee a signiant risk that the existing reery assets in Europe would not be recoverable in the net-zero emissions by 2050 scenario.

"Austria_OMV Group, 2023, Sustainability Report 2023",[b],47,794be125c97f859fe256c42070ed49d5,"The OMV Group clearly recognizes that climate change is one of the most important global challenges today and fully supports the goals set forth by the Paris Agreement. By 2050, OMV aims to transform into a net-zero business.7  OMV has set out a roadmap with concrete interim short-, medium-, and long-term targets. OMVs targets are set at an absolute and intensity level with the ultimate goal of achieving net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Scopes 1, 2, and 3 by 2050. For Scopes 1 and 2, OMV is aiming for an absolute reduction of 30 by 2030 and of 60 by 2040. For Scope 3, OMV is striving for a reduction of at least 20 by 2030 and of 50 by 2040 from our product portfolio and other material Scope 3 emissions. These absolute GHG emission reductions and the increase of zero-carbon product energy sales are key in reducing the carbon intensity of our energy supply, pursuing a decline of 20 by 2030 and of 50 by 2040. These targets are approximated to IEAs Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS). However, our ambition is to achieve net-zero emissions already by 2050, thus being aligned with the IEAs Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE). "

At present, about 78 of the OMV Groups products are directly used for combustion, signiantly contributing to global climate change. As such, we have a unique responsibility in this regard, and understand that a business as usual approach is no longer an option. "

This is the centerpiece of OMVs commitment to supporting and accelerating the energy transition, and becoming a net-zero business by 2050 or sooner in alignment with the IEAs Net Zero Emissions (NZE) scenario, which foresees limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C. To concretize our 2050 goals, we have set mid- and long-term targets to reduce our absolute Scope 3 emissions by at least 20 by 2030 and by at least 50 by 2040, both against the baseline year 2019. In addition, we intend to reduce the carbon intensity of our energy supply by at least 20 by 2030 and by at least 50 by 2040, both against the baseline year 2019. These intermediate targets on our pathway to net zero by 2050 are approximated to the IEAs Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS), which foresees limiting the global temperature rise to well below 2C and is thus aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement.

While the biggest drivers on this journey will be decreasing our fossil fuel sales and increasing our zero-carbon product sales, we also recognize that neutralization measures will be necessary. Neutralization measures include, but are not limited to, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU), and Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS). By 2030, we aim to establish CCS capacities of around 5 mn t per year as our main neutralization measure toward achieving our targets. "

Carbon capture and utilization technologies, such as capturing biogenic CO2 emissions, hydrating the CO2, and then reusing it as a chemical or aviation fuel, are crucial to reducing overall atmospheric emissions and fostering circularity. However, achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement does not just require reducing our own emissions but also helping reduce atmospheric emissions from other sources. Thus, our CCS and CCU projects include, but are not limited to, capturing our own emissions. "
