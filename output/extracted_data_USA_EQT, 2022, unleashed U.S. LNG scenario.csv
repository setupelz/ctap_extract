Based on WEO 2021 Net zero scenario, 13 TWh additional power from renewables by 2030 6 TWh of that will replace coal and rest will cover additional demand. The 6 TWh coal-to-renewable will reduce emissions by 7 GtCO2e. For the current-trend scenario, the GHG reduction from renewables is calculated using the same  split between coal replacement and meeting new demand. "
