"Switzerland_UBS, 2022, climate and nature report","[IPCC, Paris]","['Sustainability is a multi-faceted topic, and climate and nature are two critical elements which are deeply intertwined and must be addressed together in the transition to a low carbon economy.  As outlined in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Reports released in 2021 and 2022, achieving the Paris Agreement objectives requires a rapid transformation across the economy given that aggregate temperatures have already increased more than 1°C. The impacts of climate change are being felt already, as highlighted in studies such as the UK Government-sponsored The Economics of Biodiversity: The Dasgupta Review. It notes that the stock of natural capital per person has declined by 40% over the last thirty years. Land use change is one of the largest drivers of biodiversity loss and key ecosystems play a critical role in providing carbon sinks to help mitigate climate change as noted in the UN Environmental Program Emissions Gaps Report 2022 released at the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27) in November 2022. Thus, increasingly climate and nature must be jointly addressed in order to meet the goals established by both the Paris Agreement and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework agreed at the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP 15) in December 2022.

These dependencies and impacts have been documented through a range of research initiatives including the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)’Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report 2021’s Fact sheet on Biodiversity, in addition to a variety of industry-led efforts.
