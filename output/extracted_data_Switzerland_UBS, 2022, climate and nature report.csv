As outlined in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Reports released in 2021 and 2022, achieving the Paris Agreement objectives requires a rapid transformation across the economy given that aggregate temperatures have already increased more than 1C. The impacts of climate change are being felt already, as highlighted in studies such as the UK Government-sponsored The Economics of Biodiversity The Dasgupta Review. It notes that the stock of natural capital per person has declined by 40 over the last thirty years. Land use change is one of the largest drivers of biodiversity loss and key ecosystems play a critical role in providing carbon sinks to help mitigate climate change as noted in the UN Environmental Program Emissions Gaps Report 2022 released at the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27) in November 2022. Thus, increasingly climate and nature must be jointly addressed in order to meet the goals established by both the Paris Agreement and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework agreed at the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP 15) in December 2022.

The CBES exercise consisted of three 30-year climate risk scenarios, with varying degrees of severity (early policy action, late policy action and no additional policy action). It included an assessment of management actions in response to scenario results, as well as a counterparty-level analysis and a qualitative questionnaire. Overall, the scenario analyses showed mild losses and low exposure of climate-sensitive segments for business booked in UBS AG, London Branch. UBS as a firm was not formally required to participate in the exercise (as we are not a UK-headquartered bank), but volunteered to participate in order to learn from the effort given our footprint in the UK.

In our analysis, we prioritized sectors that have the highest carbon impact, as per the guidelines of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (the NZBA), and also applied additional considerations in our prioritization. These include the materiality of the sectors in terms of financial exposure and the availability of data and applicable methodologies in order to estimate baselines and develop pathways toward the goal of net zero. We then set targets for residential and commercial real estate, fossil fuels, and power generation and disclosed these in our Sustainability Report 2021.

In this way, we mitigate risks while supporting clients preparing for a low-carbon future. We will continue to manage and monitor our climate-related risks and our lending activities and aim to orient our new and existing business efforts toward net zero by 2050. We aim to do this by further strengthening our operating model and increasing our efforts in the field of transition and green finance. We also expect new technologies to emerge, along with policies and actions from governments, which will support the real economy in limiting warming to 1.5C.

For example, certain industrial processes cannot viably achieve absolute zero emissions. Those industries, however, still provide products and services that are important to society and are likely to remain relevant in the future.
