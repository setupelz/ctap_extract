This target covered its scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, as well as upstream transportation (scope 3). By 2019, Carrefour had achieved a 39 reduction in its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for Scopes 1 and 2. In light of this performance, the Group updated its climate plan for 2020, raising its aims for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, and stepping up its commitments for Scope 3 emissions. In fact, 98 of the Groups GHG emissions  are indirect, the main sources being products and packaging sold in stores (72), the use of products sold (12) and upstream transport of goods (5). "
