FY16 FY17 FY18 FY19 We committed to supporting the goals of the Paris Agreement within 12 months  of South32 being established. We developed Our Approach to Climate Change, focusing on climate change opportunity, resilience and emissions reduction. We set our long-term goal of achieving net  zero operational GHG emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 2050. We published our first GHG emissions reduction target to keep our Scope 1 GHG emissions below the FY15 baseline  by FY21. We published our inaugural Our Approach to Climate Change disclosure, in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). We committed not to develop any new greenfield energy coal basins. We announced that we would manage South Africa Energy Coal (SAEC) as a standalone business, to sustainably improve its financial performance, broaden its ownership and simplify our portfolio. We published our second Our Approach to Climate Change disclosure, including analysis of physical resilience for our Australian operations. We rolled out new emissions reduction initiatives at our operations, including the Cannington solar farm and Worsley Alumina biomass fuel trial to reduce energy coal consumption. We completed analysis  of physical resilience for all operations outside Australia. We completed decarbonisation concept studies for Worsley Alumina and Illawarra Metallurgical Coal. We set contextual water targets for Hillside Aluminium, Mozal Aluminium and Worsley Alumina in response  to projected physical impacts of climate change. "

We linked long-term executive remuneration to progress on our climate change commitments. We updated physical climate risk assessments for our operations. We updated our Sustainability Policy, reaffirming our commitment to sustainable development. We set a goal of net zero Scope 3 GHG emissions by 2050. We made a commitment  not to develop or invest in greenfield metallurgical coal projects. Our Climate Change Action Plan will be the subject of a non-binding advisory resolution at our 2022 Annual General Meeting. We achieved our first GHG emissions reduction target, keeping our Scope 1 GHG emissions below the FY15 baseline. We announced our medium-term target to halve our operational GHG emissions by 2035 compared to our FY21 baseline.
