Australia,Woodside,2021,"[Scenario, IEA, Paris]","[""The IEA's World Energy Outlook 2021 (WEO) explores three main scenarios in the analyses in the chapters and also includes projections for the Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) for continuity with previous editions of the WEO and to provide pathways that are compliant with the Paris Agreement for regions that have not yet announced net zero pledges. These scenarios are not predictions – the IEA does not have a single view on the future of the energy system. In contrast to the 2020 edition of the WEO, it does not vary the assumptions about public health and economic recovery implications across the scenarios. The scenarios are: The Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) shows a narrow but achievable pathway for the global energy sector to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050, with advanced economies reaching net zero emissions in advance of others. This scenario also meets key energy-related United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular achieving universal energy access by 2030. The NZE does not rely on emissions reductions from outside the energy sector to achieve its goals, but assumes that non-energy emissions will be reduced in the same proportion as energy emissions. It is consistent with limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5°C without a temperature overshoot (with a 50% probability). The Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) is a “well below 2°C” pathway, and represents a gateway to achieving the outcomes targeted by the Paris Agreement. The SDS assumes all energy-related SDGs are met, all current net zero pledges are achieved in full, and there are increased efforts to realise near-term emissions reductions; advanced economies reach net zero emissions by 2050, China around 2060, and all other countries by 2070 at the latest. Without assuming extensive net negative emissions, this scenario is consistent with limiting the global temperature rise to 1.65°C (with a 50% probability). With some level of net negative emissions after 2070, the temperature rise could be reduced to 1.5°C in 2100. The Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) takes account of all of the climate commitments made by governments around the world, including Nationally Determined Contributions as well as longer term net zero targets, and assumes that they will be met in full and on time. The global trends in this scenario represent the cumulative extent of the world’s ambition to tackle climate change as of mid-2021. The remaining difference in global emissions between the APS and the goals in the NZE or the Sustainable Development Scenario shows the “ambition gap” that needs to be closed to achieve the goals agreed in the Paris Agreement in 2015. The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) does not take for granted that governments will reach all announced goals. Instead, the STEPS explores where the energy system might go without additional policy implementation. As with the APS, it is not designed to achieve a particular outcome. It takes a granular, sector-by-sector look at existing policies and measures and those under development. The remaining difference in global emissions between the STEPS and the APS, represents the “implementation gap” that needs to be closed for countries to achieve their announced decarbonisation targets.

Consequently, neither of our two core scenarios are consistent with the expectation of climate policies required to accelerate the global transition to meet the stretch goal of the Paris Agreement. Although our operational emissions reduction targets align with the goals of the Paris Agreement, our two core scenarios do not.

The Aspirational Leadership scenario is a commodity sales price and carbon tax sensitivity, with all other inputs remaining equal compared to the two core scenarios and is built by design to reach net-zero emissions globally by 2050 and help us better understand the pathways to meet the Paris Agreement goal, and what this could mean for our business.

We recognised an impairment of US$202 million during the year for the Boyne smelter cash-generating unit, triggered by economic and operating performance of the smelter (refer to Note 4). When measuring the recoverable amount for this cash-generating unit we used net present value of cash flows to the end of the existing joint venture agreements in 2029, which also coincides with the Group’s targeted carbon emission reductions by 2030. The Group continues to evaluate lower emission power solutions for the smelter that could extend its life to at least 2040.
